Well, I was chairman [of the Senate Veterans Committee] for two years. And when I was chairman, we did take action.
What we did is pass a $15 billion piece of legislation which brought in many, many new doctors and nurses into the VA so that veterans in this country could get the health care when they needed it and not be on long waiting lines.
And the other part of that legislation said that if a veteran living more than 40 miles away from a VA facility, that veteran could get health care from a community health center or the private sector.
As a result of that legislation, we went further than at any time in recent history in improving health care to the men and women of this country who put their lives on the line to defend us.
