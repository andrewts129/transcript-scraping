I’m Ted Cruz. I’m the son of an Irish-Italian mom and a Cuban immigrant dad who fled oppression and came to America seeking freedom.
I’m a husband to my best friend, Heidi, who’s here tonight. I’m a dad to two little girls who are the loves of my life – Caroline and Catherine.
If you’re fed up with Washington, if you’re looking for someone to stand up to career politicians in both parties, I’m the only one on this stage that has done that over and over again.
And if we stand together, we could bring America back.
