Well, let’s understand that when we talk about Syria, you’re talking about a quagmire in a quagmire.
You’re talking about groups of people trying to overthrow Assad, other groups of people fighting ISIS.

I’m the former chairman…of the Senate Veterans Committee. And in that capacity, I learned a very powerful lesson about the cost of war.
And I will do everything that I can to make sure that the United States does not get involved in another quagmire like we did in Iraq – the worst foreign policy blunder in the history of this country.
We should be putting together a coalition of Arab countries who should be leading the effort. We should be supportive.
But I do not support American ground troops in Syria.
Hillary Clinton:
Nobody does.
