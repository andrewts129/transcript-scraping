…I’m proud to stand for life. These Planned Parenthood videos are horrifying.
I would encourage every American to watch these videos seeing your Planned Parenthood officials callously, heartlessly bartering and selling the body parts of human beings and ask yourself “Are these my values?”
These are horrifying.
On these videos, Planned Parenthood also essentially confesses to multiple felonies. It is a felony with 10 years jail term to sell the body parts of unborn children for profit. That’s what these videos showed Planned Parenthood doing.
Absolutely. We shouldn’t be sending $500 million of taxpayer money to funding an ongoing criminal enterprise.
And I’ll tell you the fact that Republican leadership in both houses has begun this discussion by preemptively surrendering to Barack Obama and saying “We’ll give in because Obama threatens a veto.”
You know, Obama’s committed to his principles, his liberal principles. He will fight for them. He says “I will veto any budget that doesn’t fund Planned Parenthood” and Republicans surrender.
We need to stop surrendering and start standing for our principles.
