…It is an honor…Thank you. Thank you very much.
It is an honor to be here tonight. Thank you! Thank you very much. Thank you. Thank you.
It is an honor to be here tonight and to be following in the footsteps of my good friend, Elizabeth Warren, and to be here tonight to thank Michelle Obama for her incredible service to our country. She has made all of us proud.
Let me begin by thanking the hundreds of thousands of Americans who actively participated in our campaign as volunteers. Thank you.
Let me thank the 2.5 million Americans who helped fund our campaign with an unprecedented 8 million individual campaign contribution. Anyone know what that average contribution was? That’s right – $27.
And let me thank the 13 million Americans who voted for the political revolution, giving us the 1,846 pledged delegates here tonight.
And delegates, thank you for being here and thank you for all the work you have done. I look forward to your votes during the roll call tomorrow night.
And let me offer a special thanks to the people of my own state of Vermont who have sustained me and supported me as a mayor, congressman, senator, and presidential candidate.
And to my family, my wife, Jane, our four kids, and seven grandchildren, thank you very much.
I understand that many people here in this convention hall and around the country are disappointed about the final results of the nominating process.
