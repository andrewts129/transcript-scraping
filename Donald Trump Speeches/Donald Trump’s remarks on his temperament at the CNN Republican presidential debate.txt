Well, first of all, Rand Paul shouldn’t even be on this stage. He’s number 11. He’s got 1% in the polls. And how he got up here – there’s far too many people anyway.
As far as temperament and we all know that. As far as temperament, I think I have a great temperament.
I’ve built a phenomenal business with incredible iconic assets – one of the really truly great real estate businesses.
And I may be an entertainer because I’ve had tremendous success with number one best sellers all over the place with the Apprentice and everything else I’ve done.
But I will tell you this what I am far and away greater than an entertainer is a businessman and that’s the kind of mindset that this country needs to bring it back.
Because we owe $19 trillion right now. $19 trillion. And you need this kind of thinking to bring our country back.
And believe me, my temperament is very good, very calm. But we will be respected outside of this country. We are not respected now.
