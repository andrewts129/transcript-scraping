Let me just respond to something the Secretary said.
First of all, she is talking about – as I understand it – a no-fly zone in Syria, which I think is a very dangerous situation. Could lead to real problems.
Second of all, I heard the same evidence from President Bush and Dick Cheney and Don Rumsfeld about why we would overthrow Saddam Hussein and get involved in the war.
I would urge people to go to BernieSanders.com, hear what I said in 2002.
And I say without any joy in my heart that much of what I thought would happen about the destabilization in fact did happen.
So I think the President is trying very hard to thread a tough needle here, and that is to support those people who are against Assad, against ISIS without getting us on the ground there. And that’s the direction I believe we should have…
Well, obviously, I voted when President Clinton said “Let’s stop ethnic cleansing in Kosovo”, I voted for that.
I voted to make sure that Osama bin Laden was held accountable in Afghanistan.
When our country is threatened or when our allies are threatened, I believe that we need coalitions to come together to address the major crises of this country. I do not support the United States getting involved in unilateral action. Work with our allies.
