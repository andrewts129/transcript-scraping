We have a country where to assimilate, you have to speak English. And I think that where he was and the way it came out didn’t sound great to me.
We have to have assimilation to have a country. We have to have assimilation.
I’m not the first one to say this…We have many people over the years for many, many years saying the same thing.
This is a country where we speak English, not Spanish.
But the simple fact is if a high school kid asks me a question in Spanish – a school by the way a voucher program that was created under my watch, the largest voucher program in the country where kids can go to a Christian school and they ask me a question in Spanish, I’m going to show respect and answer that question in Spanish even though they do speak English and even though they embrace American values.
