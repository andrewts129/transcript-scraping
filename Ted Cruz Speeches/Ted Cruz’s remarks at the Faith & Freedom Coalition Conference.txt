…I’m thrilled to be back with so many friends today.
You know, today, the body of Christ is in mourning. I want to begin by just reflecting on the horrific tragedy of last night at the Emanuel AME Church that a sick and deranged person came and prayed with a historically black congregation for an hour and then murdered nine innocent souls.
Christians across our nation, across the world, believers across the world are lifting up the congregants at Emanuel AME. And I just want to begin with a moment of silence remembering those who were murdered last night.
It’s a new morning. A new morning and we’re gathered here today focused on our country, focused on the threats facing our nation.
We have leaders in our midst. This is a gathering of leaders. Every one of you – Ralph Reed – what an extraordinary leader Ralph Reed is.
He is tenacious. I’m pretty sure he never sleeps. And I have photographic proof that even if he does sleep, when he sleeps he’s smiling.
He brings a spirit of joy and utter determination to the task at hand of motivating people of faith to stand up and take our nation back.
…I’ll tell you I am profoundly optimistic that we are going to turn our nation around and the reason I’m optimistic is because of the leaders who are gathered here today. The reason I’m optimistic is because each and every one of you standing up and leading and taking on the forces of darkness, the threats that face our nation.
…I want to talk about an issue that I think will be front and center in 2016 and that is religious liberty.
I believe 2016 will be the religious liberty election.
Religious liberty has never been more threatened in America than right now today.
And let’s talk about religious liberty both at home and abroad.
At home like many of the men and women in this room, I’ve spent decades fighting to defend religious liberty.
When I was the solicitor general of Texas, I was proud to defend the 10 Commandment Monument on the State Capitol grounds. We went to the U.S. Supreme Court and we won 5-4.
I was proud to defend the pledge of allegiance, the words “one nation, under God”. We went to the Supreme Court and we won unanimously.
And then in private practice, I was proud to join with my good friend, Kelly Shackelford, in representing over 3 million veterans pro bono for free defending the Mojave Desert Veterans Memorial.
A lone white Latin cross erected over 70 years ago to honor the men and women who gave their lives in World War I. The ACLU sued seeking to tear down that monument and they won in the district. They won in the Court of Appeals. The Court of Appeals literally ordered that a plywood box be built around the monument to hide it because they said you could not gaze upon the image of a cross on federal land.
Well, I’ll tell you this, they’re right in one thing: The cross has power.

The battles today have only intensified. Religious liberty – in fact just this week, the EPA has named religious liberty an endangered species. [Laughter]
That would be funnier if it weren’t so profoundly true.
Listen, every one of us our hearts broke a couple of months ago in Indiana and Arkansas.
Indiana and Arkansas, the battle over religious liberty there was heart breaking. The perfect storm of the modern Democratic Party and big business came together.
You know, there was a time when religious liberty brought us together, where it was a bipartisan priority, where we might say, “You know, Democrats and Republicans, we’ll disagree on marginal tax rates but when it comes to defending the protections of the First Amendment for every one of us to worship and seek out and follow the Lord God Almighty with all of our hearts, minds, and souls, on that we stand as one.”
Sadly, that is no longer the case.
The modern Democratic Party has decided that their commitment to mandatory gay marriage in all 50 states trumps any willingness to defend the First Amendment.
Two decades ago, Congress passed the Federal Religious Freedom Restoration Act. Had the support of such famed right-wing nutcases as Ted Kennedy, Chuck Schumer, and Joe Biden. Was signed into law by a Democrat Bill Clinton. [Laughter]
That law was subsequently identical to what both Indiana and Arkansas took up.
And yet today’s Democratic Party aided by their friends in the media and aided even more by big business that decided it was good business to throw Christians overboard and to abandon religious liberty, pounded upon leaders there.
And I’ll tell you what was saddest just how many Republicans ran for the hills.
I think Indiana was, as Ronald Reagan would have put it, a time for choosing. As William Barret Travis in Texas put it when he drew a line in the sand, “You choose which side of the line you’re on.”
More than a few Republicans sadly – even more than a few Republicans running for President in 2016 – chose that moment somehow to go rearrange their sock drawer.
I’ll tell you this: I will never ever, ever shy from standing up and defending the religious liberty of every American.
Let me tell you this story of a couple I met in Iowa. Dick and Betty Odgaard – a wonderful couple.
They have a farm with an old historic church on that farm.
For years, they hosted weddings in this church and they made a business of catering the weddings. It’s how they help provide for their livelihood.
Well, a couple of years ago, two gay men wanted to have a wedding in the Odgaard’s church.
Now, the Odgaards are devout Mennonites and they said, “No, I’m sorry. We cannot host this. This is inconsistent with our faith.”
The Odgaards found themselves drawn into litigation, extended legal battle. Ultimately, they wrote a check for $5,000 and promised never again to host a wedding in that church.
Religious liberty is under assault.
Now, all of us are aware in a couple of weeks the Supreme Court is going to issue a decision concerning marriage, and I would encourage everyone here to be lifting up in prayer the court that they not engage in an act of naked and lawless act of judicial activism tearing down the marriage laws adopted pursuant to the Constitution.
And I was proud to represent 3 million veterans before the U.S. Supreme Court defending that monument and we won 5-4.

But to underscore the threat to religious liberty, one need look no further than an exchange during the oral argument where Justice Alito asked the Obama solicitor general Don Verrilli, “If the Obama administration prevails and you convince this court to attempt to strike down the marriage laws of every state, would the next step be that the IRS will start going after Christian schools, Christian universities, Christian charities, and next after that Christian churches? Any institution that follows a biblical teaching of marriage or for that matter Jewish schools, Mormon schools? Any institution that follows religious teachings?”
And the answer from the Obama administration to the U.S. Supreme Court is, “Yes.” That is a very real possibility that the next step is the IRS coming after schools, universities, charities.
This is a time where we decide who we are, what we believe.
We’re a nation that was founded by men and women fleeing religious oppression.
We’re a nation that was founded – there is a reason why religious liberty is the very first protection in the very first amendment to the Bill of Rights because it is all foundational. We cannot stand unless we first are on our knees.
And we look at religious liberty at home, abroad, it’s even worse.
Abroad we’re right now seeing religious persecution at a level that is horrifying.
And we have a President who refuses to acknowledge it.
You cannot defeat radical Islamic terrorism with a President who’s unwilling to utter the words “radical Islamic terrorism”.
We remember several months ago the horrific terrorist attack in Paris that the President inexplicably described as a “random act of violence”.
When radical Islamists with butcher knives go into a kosher deli seeking to murder Jews because of their Jewish faith, there ain’t nothing random about that.
It is a naked and transparent act of anti-Semitism and religious bigotry and it needs to be called out for precisely what it is.
When ISIS beheaded 21 Coptic Christians, the White House put out a statement that said they were killed because of their Egyptian citizenship.
You know, Pope Francis powerfully observed their blood confesses Jesus Christ.
In Kenya, 147 Christians were murdered Al Shabaab radical Islamic terrorists. And just to make it transparently clear for this administration, they sorted among the people and asked if you were a Muslim you were spared. If you were a Christian, you were shot in the back of the head execution style. 147 Christians on Good Friday.
If you go to the White House and read the statement about the massacre in Kenya, you will search in vain for the words Christian or Islam.
We must speak the truth.

The truth has power.
It has power when we speak up for Pastor Saeed Abedini, wrongfully imprisoned.
It had power when the men and women in this room spoke up for Mariam Ibrahim, wrongfully prisoned.
It has power when the men and women in this room stand up and speak out for the Nation of Israel.
Can you imagine six years ago if I had told you that Prime Minister Netanyahu would come address a joint session of Congress and the President, the Vice President, and the entire cabinet would boycott the Prime Minister of Israel? That’s how bad things have gotten.
And yet, the word tells us weeping may endure for a night, but joy cometh in the morning.
And I’ll tell you this. Morning is coming. Morning is coming.
And the men and women in this room are going to play a critical role.
Our country’s at a crossroads. If people of faith stand up and lead, if the leaders, in this room – each and every one of you in your communities, you have a circle of influence – friends, families, pastors that as you reach out, there are right now about 90 million evangelical Christians in America, 50 million evangelicals are staying home. 50 million.
Reagan Democrats, blue collar working class Catholics up and down the Midwest, up into New England, if we’re going to turn the country around, the work that Ralph and Penny are doing, the work that every one of you are doing to turn out people of faith, it’s a real simple reforming if people of faith show up, if we stand for our faith and our liberty and the Constitution, we will win and turn the country around.
And I’m going to close with a quick story. I mentioned that morning is coming. We can – I’m the faith that morning will come, that it will be Jan. 20, 2017.
On Jan. 20, 2017, a little old man walks up to the front gate of the White House. Young Marine standing guard. Little old man says, “Excuse me, sir, is Barack Obama here?” The Marine says, “I’m sorry. Barack Obama is no longer President of the United States.”
The next day, Jan. 21st, the same little old man comes up to the same Marine and ask the same question, “Sir, is Barack Obama here?” He says, “No, sir, Barack Obama is no longer President of the United States.”
The third day he comes up now Jan. 22nd, same little old man, same Marine. He says, “Excuse me, sir. Is Barack Obama here?” At this point, the Marine is frustrated. He sighs, “Sir, I’ve told you three days in a row, Barack Obama is no longer President of the United States.”
And the little old man with a twinkle in his eyes, he goes, “I know that. I just love hearing you say it.”
And the Marine stands to attention, salutes, and says, “See you tomorrow, sir.”
Morning is coming and it is thanks to each and every one of you.
God bless you and God bless the United States of America.
