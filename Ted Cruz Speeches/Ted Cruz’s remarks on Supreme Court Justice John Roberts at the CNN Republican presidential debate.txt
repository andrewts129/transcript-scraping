I’ve known John Roberts for 20 years. He’s an amazingly talented lawyer but yes, it was a mistake when he was appointed to the Supreme Court.
He’s a good enough lawyer that he knows in these Obamacare cares he changed the statute, he changed the law in order to force that failed law and millions of Americans for a political outcome.
And you know, we’re frustrated as conservatives. We keep winning elections and then we don’t get the outcome we wanted.
Let me focus on two moments in time. Number one, in 1990, in one room was David Souter, in another room was Edith Jones, the rock-rip conservative on the Fifth Circuit Court of Appeals.
George Herbert Walker Bush appointed David Souter.
And then in 2005, in one room was John Roberts and in another room was my former boss, Mike Ludick, the rock-rip conservative on the Fourth Circuit Court of Appeals.
George W. Bush appointed John Roberts.
And let me give you the consequences of that. If instead the President Bushes have appointed Edith Jones and Mike Ludick, which is who I would have appointed, Obamacare would have been struck down three years ago and the marriage laws of all 50 states would be on the books.
These matter and I fought to defend the Constitution my whole life…
