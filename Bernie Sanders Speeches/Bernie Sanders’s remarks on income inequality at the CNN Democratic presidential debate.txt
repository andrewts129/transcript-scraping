Well, first of all, let’s remember where we were when Bush left office. We were losing 800,000 jobs a month.
And I know my Republican friends seem to have some amnesia on this issue.
But the world’s financial markets were on the verge – system – was the verge of collapse.
That’s where we were. Are we better off today than we were then? Absolutely.
But the truth is that for the last 40 years, the great middle class in this country has been disappearing.
And in my view, what we need to do is to create millions of jobs by rebuilding our crumbling infrastructure, raise the minimum wage to $15 an hour, pay equity for women workers, end our disastrous trade policies which have cost us millions of jobs and make every public college and university in this country tuition free.
