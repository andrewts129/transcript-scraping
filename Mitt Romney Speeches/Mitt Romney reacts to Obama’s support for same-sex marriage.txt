“I have the same view on marriage that I have when I was Governor and that I’ve expressed many times. I believe marriage is a relationship between a man and a woman.
“States are able to make decisions with regards to domestic partnership benefits, such as hospital visitation rights, benefits and so forth of various kinds could be determined state-by-state. But my view is that marriage itself is a relationship between a man and a woman, and that’s my own preference. I know other people have different views. This is a very tender and sensitive topic as are many social issues, but I have the same view that I’ve had since, well, since running for office.
“I believe that based upon the interview that he [President Obama] gave today on ABC, it said that he had changed his view. But you’re a better judge of that than I. I just saw the reports that he had previously said he opposed same-sex marriage and now according to ABC News he’s saying that he supports it. So if that’s the case then you’ll be able to make that determination on your own.”
