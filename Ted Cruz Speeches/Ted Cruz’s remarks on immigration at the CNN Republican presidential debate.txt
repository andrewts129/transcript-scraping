…I’m very glad that Donald Trump being in this race has forced the mainstream media finally to talk about illegal immigration.
I think that’s very important. I like and respect Ben Carson. I’ll let him talk about his own plans.
But I will say this. The natural next question the primary voters are asking after we focus on illegal immigration is “Okay, what are the records of the various candidates?”
And this is an issue on which there are stark differences.
A majority of the men and women on this stage have previously and publicly embraced amnesty.
I am the only candidate on this stage who has never supported amnesty and in fact, who helped lead the fight to stop a massive amnesty plan in 2013 when Barack Obama and Harry Reid joined the Washington Republicans in a massive amnesty plan.
I stood shoulder to shoulder with Jeff Sessions helping lead the fight.
You know, folks here have talked about how do you secure the borders? Well, I’ve been leading the fight in the Senate to triple the border patrol, to put in place fencings and walls, to put in place a strong biometric exit-entry system.
