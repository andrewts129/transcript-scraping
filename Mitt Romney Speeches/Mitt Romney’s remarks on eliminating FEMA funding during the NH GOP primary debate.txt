“Gov. Romney, you’ve been the chief executive of a state. I was just in Joplin, Missouri. I’ve been in Mississippi, Louisiana, Tennessee and other communities dealing with the tornadoes, the flooding and worse. FEMA’s about to run out of money, and there are some people that say do it on a case-by-case basis and some people who say, you know, maybe we’re learning a lesson here and maybe the state should take more of this role. How do you deal with something like that?”
“Absolutely. Every time you have an occasion to take something from the federal government and send it back to the states, that’s the right direction. And if you can go even further and send it back to the private sector, that’s even better.
“Instead of thinking in the federal budget what we should cut, we should ask ourselves the opposite question: What should we keep? We should take all of what we’re doing at the federal level and say what are the things we’re doing that we don’t have to do and those things we’ve got to stop doing because we’re borrowing $1.6 trillion more this year than we’re taking in. We cannot – we cannot afford to do those things without jeopardizing the future of our kids. It’s simply immoral, in my view, for us to continue to rack up larger and larger debts and pass them on to our kids knowing full well that we’ll be dead and gone before it’s paid off.”
