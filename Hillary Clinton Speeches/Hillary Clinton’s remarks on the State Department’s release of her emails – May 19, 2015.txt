And to follow up on the questions about the speeches, was there conflict of interest in your giving paid speeches into the run-up of your announcement that you’re running for President?
And the answer to the first is I have said repeatedly I want those emails out. Nobody has a bigger interest in getting them released than I do.
I respect the State Department. They have their process that they do for everybody not just for me. But anything that they might do to expedite that process I heartedly support.
You know, I want the American people to learn as much as we can about the work that I did with our diplomats and our development experts because I think it will show how hard we worked and what we did for our country during the time that I was Secretary of State where I worked extremely hard on behalf of our values and our interests and our security, and the emails are part of that.
So I have said publicly, I’m repeating it here in front of all of you today, I want them out as soon as they can get out.
