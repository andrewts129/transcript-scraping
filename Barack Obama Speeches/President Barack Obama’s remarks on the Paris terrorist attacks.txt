…I want to begin by just saying a few words about the tragic event that we’ve watched unfold in France over the last several hours and days.
Because of the event’s been fast-moving this morning, I want to make sure to comment on them.
I just spoke to my counter-terrorism adviser. We have been in close touch with the French government throughout this tragedy.
The moment the outrageous attack took place, we directed all of our law enforcement and counter-intelligence operations to provide whatever support that our ally needs in confronting this challenge.
We’re hopeful that the immediate threat is now resolved thanks to the courage and professionalism of the French personnel on the ground.
But the French government continues to face the threat of terrorism and has to remain vigilant. The situation is fluid. President Hollande has made it clear that they’re going to do whatever is necessary to protect their people.
And I think it’s important for people to understand France is our oldest ally. I want the people of France to know that the United States stands with you, stands with you tomorrow.
Our thoughts and prayers are with the families who’ve been directly impacted. We grieve with you. We fight alongside you to uphold our values – the values that we share – universal values that bind us together as friends and as allies.
And in the streets of Paris, the world has seen once again what terrorists stand for. They have nothing to offer but hatred and suffering.
And we stand for freedom and hope and the dignity of all human beings, and that’s what the city of Paris represents to the world and that spirit will endure forever long after the scourge of terrorism has vanished from this world.
