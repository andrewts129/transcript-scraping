“I believe the status on young people who come here through no fault of their own is an important matter to be considered and should be solved on a long-term basis so they know what their future would be in this country.
“I think the action that the President took today makes it more difficult to reach that long-term solution because an executive order is, of course, just a short-term matter and can be reversed by subsequent Presidents.
“I’d like to see legislation that deals with this issue. And I happen to agree with Marco Rubio as he looked this issue. He said that this is an important matter, that we have to look at a long-term solution but that the President’s action makes reaching a long-term solution more difficult.
“If I’m President, we’ll do our very best to have that kind of long-term solution that provides certainty and clarity for the people who come into this country through no fault of their own by virtue of the actions of their parents.
“Thank you.”
