“I want to tell you a love story. It’s the story of all of us, a love story of freedom.
“It’s the story of our Founding Fathers, who fought and bled for freedom and then crafted the most miraculous political document ever conceived, our Constitution. The Framers understood that our rights come, not from monarchs, but from God-and that those rights are secure only when government power is restrained.

“It’s the story of civil-rights heroes, like Dr. Martin Luther King, who stood strong against the scourge of discrimination, and bravely championed that every man and woman should be judged, not by the color of our skin, but by the content of our character.
“It’s the story of President Ronald Reagan, who turned back the creeping growth of government and restored Morning in America. Who spoke out against the oppressive evil of communism and demanded “Mr. Gorbachev, tear down this wall.”
“It’s the story of my Mom. Irish and Italian, working class, the first in her family to go to college – a pioneering mathematician and computer programmer in the 1950s.
“It’s the story of my Dad, who was imprisoned and tortured in Cuba, beaten nearly to death. He fled to Texas in 1957, not speaking English, with $100 sewn into his underwear. He washed dishes making 50 cents an hour to pay his way through the University of Texas, and to start a small business in the oil and gas industry.
“My father is here tonight. When he came to America, él no tenía nada, pero tenía corazón. He had nothing, but he had heart. A heart for freedom. Thank you, Dad.
“It’s the story of each and every one of you. We are all sons and daughters of those who risked everything for freedom, and we have the duty to pass that same opportunity to the generations to follow.
“And yet today, many in Washington seem content to saddle our children with a financial debt larger than our nation has ever seen.
“Government is out of control, and we’re going broke.
“But I’m here with a word of encouragement. Millions of Americans are standing up, saying we want our country back. Republicans, Democrats, and independents. We will not follow the path of Greece; we will not go quietly into the night.
“This election presents a stark choice. Two visions: we can continue down the road of the Obama Democrats, towards more and more spending, debt and government control of the economy and our lives. Or we can return to the founding principles of our nation-free markets, fiscal responsibility, and individual liberty.
“Unfortunately, President Obama’s campaign is going to try to divide America. They’re going to try to separate us into little groups, and try to scare everybody. They’re going to tell seniors that Medicare will be taken away, tell Hispanics that we’re not welcome here and send the Vice President to preach a message of division.
“It’s sad, how far we’ve come from hope and change.
“All of this is designed to distract from the real issues that matter. Twenty-three million Americans struggling for work. Sixteen trillion dollars in national debt. Government takeovers of healthcare, of financial services and many aspects of our economy.

“That’s exactly the impact of this administration’s misguided policies. Heidi and I are blessed with two little girls, Caroline and Catherine, 4 and 1.

“How do we turn things around? How do we get America back to work? President Obama thinks the answer is more and more government.
“Government is not the answer. You are not doing anyone a favor by creating dependency, destroying individual responsibility.
“Fifty-five years ago, when my dad was a penniless teenage immigrant, thank God some well-meaning bureaucrat didn’t put his arm around him and say let me take care of you. Let me give you a government check and make you dependent on government. And by the way, don’t bother learning English. That would have been the most destructive thing anyone could have done.
“Instead, my parents worked together to start a small business, to provide for their family and to chart their own future. That’s the American dream, and Mitt Romney and Paul Ryan understand that.
“Under President Obama, 23 million Americans are struggling for work. Hispanic unemployment has risen to over 10 percent; African-American unemployment is over 14 percent. This is tragic.
“And here I want to say something especially to the Democrats who are listening tonight. You can send a wake-up message to your party-the party that was once proud to be the party of working people. Obama’s policies have failed.

…I’m thrilled to be back with so many friends today.
You know, today, the body of Christ is in mourning. I want to begin by just reflecting on the horrific tragedy of last night at the Emanuel AME Church that a sick and deranged person came and prayed with a historically black congregation for an hour and then murdered nine innocent souls.
Christians across our nation, across the world, believers across the world are lifting up the congregants at Emanuel AME. And I just want to begin with a moment of silence remembering those who were murdered last night.
It’s a new morning. A new morning and we’re gathered here today focused on our country, focused on the threats facing our nation.
We have leaders in our midst. This is a gathering of leaders. Every one of you – Ralph Reed – what an extraordinary leader Ralph Reed is.
He is tenacious. I’m pretty sure he never sleeps. And I have photographic proof that even if he does sleep, when he sleeps he’s smiling.
He brings a spirit of joy and utter determination to the task at hand of motivating people of faith to stand up and take our nation back.
…I’ll tell you I am profoundly optimistic that we are going to turn our nation around and the reason I’m optimistic is because of the leaders who are gathered here today. The reason I’m optimistic is because each and every one of you standing up and leading and taking on the forces of darkness, the threats that face our nation.
…I want to talk about an issue that I think will be front and center in 2016 and that is religious liberty.
I believe 2016 will be the religious liberty election.
Religious liberty has never been more threatened in America than right now today.
And let’s talk about religious liberty both at home and abroad.
At home like many of the men and women in this room, I’ve spent decades fighting to defend religious liberty.
When I was the solicitor general of Texas, I was proud to defend the 10 Commandment Monument on the State Capitol grounds. We went to the U.S. Supreme Court and we won 5-4.
I was proud to defend the pledge of allegiance, the words “one nation, under God”. We went to the Supreme Court and we won unanimously.
And then in private practice, I was proud to join with my good friend, Kelly Shackelford, in representing over 3 million veterans pro bono for free defending the Mojave Desert Veterans Memorial.
A lone white Latin cross erected over 70 years ago to honor the men and women who gave their lives in World War I. The ACLU sued seeking to tear down that monument and they won in the district. They won in the Court of Appeals. The Court of Appeals literally ordered that a plywood box be built around the monument to hide it because they said you could not gaze upon the image of a cross on federal land.
Well, I’ll tell you this, they’re right in one thing: The cross has power.
…I’m thrilled to be back with so many friends today.

The battles today have only intensified. Religious liberty – in fact just this week, the EPA has named religious liberty an endangered species. [Laughter]
That would be funnier if it weren’t so profoundly true.
Listen, every one of us our hearts broke a couple of months ago in Indiana and Arkansas.
Indiana and Arkansas, the battle over religious liberty there was heart breaking. The perfect storm of the modern Democratic Party and big business came together.
You know, there was a time when religious liberty brought us together, where it was a bipartisan priority, where we might say, “You know, Democrats and Republicans, we’ll disagree on marginal tax rates but when it comes to defending the protections of the First Amendment for every one of us to worship and seek out and follow the Lord God Almighty with all of our hearts, minds, and souls, on that we stand as one.”
Sadly, that is no longer the case.
The modern Democratic Party has decided that their commitment to mandatory gay marriage in all 50 states trumps any willingness to defend the First Amendment.
Two decades ago, Congress passed the Federal Religious Freedom Restoration Act. Had the support of such famed right-wing nutcases as Ted Kennedy, Chuck Schumer, and Joe Biden. Was signed into law by a Democrat Bill Clinton. [Laughter]
That law was subsequently identical to what both Indiana and Arkansas took up.
And yet today’s Democratic Party aided by their friends in the media and aided even more by big business that decided it was good business to throw Christians overboard and to abandon religious liberty, pounded upon leaders there.
And I’ll tell you what was saddest just how many Republicans ran for the hills.
I think Indiana was, as Ronald Reagan would have put it, a time for choosing. As William Barret Travis in Texas put it when he drew a line in the sand, “You choose which side of the line you’re on.”
More than a few Republicans sadly – even more than a few Republicans running for President in 2016 – chose that moment somehow to go rearrange their sock drawer.
I’ll tell you this: I will never ever, ever shy from standing up and defending the religious liberty of every American.
Let me tell you this story of a couple I met in Iowa. Dick and Betty Odgaard – a wonderful couple.
They have a farm with an old historic church on that farm.
For years, they hosted weddings in this church and they made a business of catering the weddings. It’s how they help provide for their livelihood.
Well, a couple of years ago, two gay men wanted to have a wedding in the Odgaard’s church.
Now, the Odgaards are devout Mennonites and they said, “No, I’m sorry. We cannot host this. This is inconsistent with our faith.”
The Odgaards found themselves drawn into litigation, extended legal battle. Ultimately, they wrote a check for $5,000 and promised never again to host a wedding in that church.
Religious liberty is under assault.
Now, all of us are aware in a couple of weeks the Supreme Court is going to issue a decision concerning marriage, and I would encourage everyone here to be lifting up in prayer the court that they not engage in an act of naked and lawless act of judicial activism tearing down the marriage laws adopted pursuant to the Constitution.
And I was proud to represent 3 million veterans before the U.S. Supreme Court defending that monument and we won 5-4.

But to underscore the threat to religious liberty, one need look no further than an exchange during the oral argument where Justice Alito asked the Obama solicitor general Don Verrilli, “If the Obama administration prevails and you convince this court to attempt to strike down the marriage laws of every state, would the next step be that the IRS will start going after Christian schools, Christian universities, Christian charities, and next after that Christian churches? Any institution that follows a biblical teaching of marriage or for that matter Jewish schools, Mormon schools? Any institution that follows religious teachings?”
And the answer from the Obama administration to the U.S. Supreme Court is, “Yes.” That is a very real possibility that the next step is the IRS coming after schools, universities, charities.
This is a time where we decide who we are, what we believe.
We’re a nation that was founded by men and women fleeing religious oppression.
We’re a nation that was founded – there is a reason why religious liberty is the very first protection in the very first amendment to the Bill of Rights because it is all foundational. We cannot stand unless we first are on our knees.
And we look at religious liberty at home, abroad, it’s even worse.
Abroad we’re right now seeing religious persecution at a level that is horrifying.
And we have a President who refuses to acknowledge it.
You cannot defeat radical Islamic terrorism with a President who’s unwilling to utter the words “radical Islamic terrorism”.
We remember several months ago the horrific terrorist attack in Paris that the President inexplicably described as a “random act of violence”.
When radical Islamists with butcher knives go into a kosher deli seeking to murder Jews because of their Jewish faith, there ain’t nothing random about that.
It is a naked and transparent act of anti-Semitism and religious bigotry and it needs to be called out for precisely what it is.
When ISIS beheaded 21 Coptic Christians, the White House put out a statement that said they were killed because of their Egyptian citizenship.
You know, Pope Francis powerfully observed their blood confesses Jesus Christ.
In Kenya, 147 Christians were murdered Al Shabaab radical Islamic terrorists. And just to make it transparently clear for this administration, they sorted among the people and asked if you were a Muslim you were spared. If you were a Christian, you were shot in the back of the head execution style. 147 Christians on Good Friday.
If you go to the White House and read the statement about the massacre in Kenya, you will search in vain for the words Christian or Islam.
We must speak the truth.

We must speak the truth.
The truth has power.
It has power when we speak up for Pastor Saeed Abedini, wrongfully imprisoned.
It had power when the men and women in this room spoke up for Mariam Ibrahim, wrongfully prisoned.
It has power when the men and women in this room stand up and speak out for the Nation of Israel.
Can you imagine six years ago if I had told you that Prime Minister Netanyahu would come address a joint session of Congress and the President, the Vice President, and the entire cabinet would boycott the Prime Minister of Israel? That’s how bad things have gotten.
And yet, the word tells us weeping may endure for a night, but joy cometh in the morning.
And I’ll tell you this. Morning is coming. Morning is coming.
And the men and women in this room are going to play a critical role.
Our country’s at a crossroads. If people of faith stand up and lead, if the leaders, in this room – each and every one of you in your communities, you have a circle of influence – friends, families, pastors that as you reach out, there are right now about 90 million evangelical Christians in America, 50 million evangelicals are staying home. 50 million.
Reagan Democrats, blue collar working class Catholics up and down the Midwest, up into New England, if we’re going to turn the country around, the work that Ralph and Penny are doing, the work that every one of you are doing to turn out people of faith, it’s a real simple reforming if people of faith show up, if we stand for our faith and our liberty and the Constitution, we will win and turn the country around.
And I’m going to close with a quick story. I mentioned that morning is coming. We can – I’m the faith that morning will come, that it will be Jan. 20, 2017.
On Jan. 20, 2017, a little old man walks up to the front gate of the White House. Young Marine standing guard. Little old man says, “Excuse me, sir, is Barack Obama here?” The Marine says, “I’m sorry. Barack Obama is no longer President of the United States.”
The next day, Jan. 21st, the same little old man comes up to the same Marine and ask the same question, “Sir, is Barack Obama here?” He says, “No, sir, Barack Obama is no longer President of the United States.”
The third day he comes up now Jan. 22nd, same little old man, same Marine. He says, “Excuse me, sir. Is Barack Obama here?” At this point, the Marine is frustrated. He sighs, “Sir, I’ve told you three days in a row, Barack Obama is no longer President of the United States.”
And the little old man with a twinkle in his eyes, he goes, “I know that. I just love hearing you say it.”
And the Marine stands to attention, salutes, and says, “See you tomorrow, sir.”
Morning is coming and it is thanks to each and every one of you.
God bless you and God bless the United States of America.
The truth has power.
It has power when we speak up for Pastor Saeed Abedini, wrongfully imprisoned.
It had power when the men and women in this room spoke up for Mariam Ibrahim, wrongfully prisoned.
It has power when the men and women in this room stand up and speak out for the Nation of Israel.
Can you imagine six years ago if I had told you that Prime Minister Netanyahu would come address a joint session of Congress and the President, the Vice President, and the entire cabinet would boycott the Prime Minister of Israel? That’s how bad things have gotten.
And yet, the word tells us weeping may endure for a night, but joy cometh in the morning.
And I’ll tell you this. Morning is coming. Morning is coming.
And the men and women in this room are going to play a critical role.
Our country’s at a crossroads. If people of faith stand up and lead, if the leaders, in this room – each and every one of you in your communities, you have a circle of influence – friends, families, pastors that as you reach out, there are right now about 90 million evangelical Christians in America, 50 million evangelicals are staying home. 50 million.
Reagan Democrats, blue collar working class Catholics up and down the Midwest, up into New England, if we’re going to turn the country around, the work that Ralph and Penny are doing, the work that every one of you are doing to turn out people of faith, it’s a real simple reforming if people of faith show up, if we stand for our faith and our liberty and the Constitution, we will win and turn the country around.
And I’m going to close with a quick story. I mentioned that morning is coming. We can – I’m the faith that morning will come, that it will be Jan. 20, 2017.
On Jan. 20, 2017, a little old man walks up to the front gate of the White House. Young Marine standing guard. Little old man says, “Excuse me, sir, is Barack Obama here?” The Marine says, “I’m sorry. Barack Obama is no longer President of the United States.”
The next day, Jan. 21st, the same little old man comes up to the same Marine and ask the same question, “Sir, is Barack Obama here?” He says, “No, sir, Barack Obama is no longer President of the United States.”
The third day he comes up now Jan. 22nd, same little old man, same Marine. He says, “Excuse me, sir. Is Barack Obama here?” At this point, the Marine is frustrated. He sighs, “Sir, I’ve told you three days in a row, Barack Obama is no longer President of the United States.”
And the little old man with a twinkle in his eyes, he goes, “I know that. I just love hearing you say it.”
And the Marine stands to attention, salutes, and says, “See you tomorrow, sir.”
Morning is coming and it is thanks to each and every one of you.
God bless you and God bless the United States of America.
I’m Ted Cruz. I’m the son of an Irish-Italian mom and a Cuban immigrant dad who fled oppression and came to America seeking freedom.
I’m a husband to my best friend, Heidi, who’s here tonight. I’m a dad to two little girls who are the loves of my life – Caroline and Catherine.
If you’re fed up with Washington, if you’re looking for someone to stand up to career politicians in both parties, I’m the only one on this stage that has done that over and over again.
And if we stand together, we could bring America back.

…The single biggest national security threat facing America right now is the threat of a nuclear Iran.
We’ve seen six and a half years of President Obama leading from behind. Weakness is provocative in this Iranian nuclear deal is nothing short of catastrophic.
This deal on its face will send over $100 billion to the Ayatollah Khomeini, making the Obama administration’s the world leading financier of radical Islamic terrorism.
This deal abandons four American hostages in Iran and this deal will only accelerate Iran’s acquiring of nuclear weapons. You’d better believe it.
If I am elected President on the very first day in office, I will rip to shreds this catastrophic Iranian nuclear deal.

…The number one test for use of military force should be the vital national security interests of the United States.
The reason why I opposed President Obama bombing Syria is because he couldn’t answer the question “What do you do if chemical weapons end up in the hands of radical Islamic terrorists like al-Nusra, like al-Qaeda, like ISIS?
Now, I also want to respond to several of the folks up here who said we should trust this Iranian deal and see if the Iranians will comply. Anyone who’s paying attention to what Khomeini says knows that they will not comply.
There’s a reason why Khomeini refers to Israel as the “little Satan” and America as the “great Satan”.
In the middle of negotiating this treaty, Khomeini led the assembled masses in chanting “Death to America”.
I’m reminded of a great editorial cartoon. It shows the Ayatollah Khomeini saying “Death to all Americans” and it shows John Kerry coming back and saying “Can we meet you halfway?”
We need a commander in chief who will stand up and protect this country.
And I’ll tell you I can’t wait to stand on that debate stage with Hillary Clinton and to make abundantly clear if you vote for Hillary, you were voting for the Ayatollah Khomeini to possess a nuclear weapon.
And if you elect me as President, under no circumstances will a theocratic ayatollah who chants “Death to America” ever be allowed to acquire a nuclear weapon.

…I’m proud to stand for life. These Planned Parenthood videos are horrifying.
I would encourage every American to watch these videos seeing your Planned Parenthood officials callously, heartlessly bartering and selling the body parts of human beings and ask yourself “Are these my values?”
These are horrifying.
On these videos, Planned Parenthood also essentially confesses to multiple felonies. It is a felony with 10 years jail term to sell the body parts of unborn children for profit. That’s what these videos showed Planned Parenthood doing.
Absolutely. We shouldn’t be sending $500 million of taxpayer money to funding an ongoing criminal enterprise.
And I’ll tell you the fact that Republican leadership in both houses has begun this discussion by preemptively surrendering to Barack Obama and saying “We’ll give in because Obama threatens a veto.”
You know, Obama’s committed to his principles, his liberal principles. He will fight for them. He says “I will veto any budget that doesn’t fund Planned Parenthood” and Republicans surrender.
We need to stop surrendering and start standing for our principles.

…I’m very glad that Donald Trump being in this race has forced the mainstream media finally to talk about illegal immigration.
I think that’s very important. I like and respect Ben Carson. I’ll let him talk about his own plans.
But I will say this. The natural next question the primary voters are asking after we focus on illegal immigration is “Okay, what are the records of the various candidates?”
And this is an issue on which there are stark differences.
A majority of the men and women on this stage have previously and publicly embraced amnesty.
I am the only candidate on this stage who has never supported amnesty and in fact, who helped lead the fight to stop a massive amnesty plan in 2013 when Barack Obama and Harry Reid joined the Washington Republicans in a massive amnesty plan.
I stood shoulder to shoulder with Jeff Sessions helping lead the fight.
You know, folks here have talked about how do you secure the borders? Well, I’ve been leading the fight in the Senate to triple the border patrol, to put in place fencings and walls, to put in place a strong biometric exit-entry system.

I’ve known John Roberts for 20 years. He’s an amazingly talented lawyer but yes, it was a mistake when he was appointed to the Supreme Court.
He’s a good enough lawyer that he knows in these Obamacare cares he changed the statute, he changed the law in order to force that failed law and millions of Americans for a political outcome.
And you know, we’re frustrated as conservatives. We keep winning elections and then we don’t get the outcome we wanted.
Let me focus on two moments in time. Number one, in 1990, in one room was David Souter, in another room was Edith Jones, the rock-rip conservative on the Fifth Circuit Court of Appeals.
George Herbert Walker Bush appointed David Souter.
And then in 2005, in one room was John Roberts and in another room was my former boss, Mike Ludick, the rock-rip conservative on the Fourth Circuit Court of Appeals.
George W. Bush appointed John Roberts.
And let me give you the consequences of that. If instead the President Bushes have appointed Edith Jones and Mike Ludick, which is who I would have appointed, Obamacare would have been struck down three years ago and the marriage laws of all 50 states would be on the books.
These matter and I fought to defend the Constitution my whole life…

I am not, and you mentioned that the U.S. Supreme Court had rightly upheld the individual right to keep and bear arms.
I was proud to lead 31 states before the U.S. Supreme Court defending the Second Amendment and we won that landmark victory.
And indeed, just a couple of years ago when Harry Reid and Barack Obama came after the right to keep and bear arms of millions of Americans, I was proud to lead the fight in the United States Senate to protect our right to keep and bear arms.
And for that reason, I was honored to be endorsed by Gun Owners of America as the strongest supporter of the Second Amendment on this stage today and I will fight everyday to protect that right.

Ronald Reagan believed in America. If I’m elected President, our friends and allies across the globe will know that we stand with them.
The bust of Winston Churchill will be back in the Oval Office and the American Embassy in Israel will be in Jerusalem.
Enemies across this world will know the United States is not to be trifled with.
ISIS will be defeated. We will have a President willing to utter the words radical Islamic terrorism, and the Ayatollah Khomeini will understand that he will never, ever ever acquire nuclear weapons.
Here at home, we’ll reignite the promise of America.
Young people coming out of school with student loans up to their eyeballs will find instead of no jobs two, three, four, five job opportunities. How will that happen?
Through tax reform. We’ll pass a simple flat tax and abolish the IRS.
And through regulatory reform. We will repeal every word of Obamacare.
You want to know what I’ll do as President? It’s real simple. We’ll kill the terrorists. We’ll repeal Obamacare. And we will defend the Constitution every single word of it.

God bless the great state of Iowa!
Let me first of all say to God be the glory.
Tonight is a victory for the grassroots.
Tonight is a victory for courageous conservatives across Iowa and all across this great nation.
Tonight, the state of Iowa has spoken. Iowa has sent notice and the Republican nominee and the next president of the United States will not be chosen by the media.
Will not be chosen by the Washington establishment.
Will not be chosen by the lobbyists.
But will be chosen by the most incredible, powerful force where all sovereignty resides in our nation – by we the people – the American people.
Tonight, thanks to the incredible hard work of everyone gathered here, of courageous conservatives across this state, we together earned the votes of 48,608 Iowans.
To put it in perspective, your incredible victory that you have won tonight that is the most votes ever cast for any Republican primary winner.
Tonight is a victory for millions of Americans who have shouldered the burden of seven years of Washington deals run amok.
Tonight is a victory for every American who has watched in dismay as career politicians in Washington in both parties refuse to listen to and too often to keep their commitments to the people.
Tonight is a victory for every American who understands that after we survive eight long years of the Obama presidency, that no one personality can right the wrongs done by Washington.

The millions who understand that it is a commitment to the Constitution, to our shared insistence that we rise and return to a higher standard – the very standard that gave birth to the greatest nation that the world has ever known.
To the revolutionary understanding that all men and all women are created equal.
That our rights do not come from the Democratic Party or the Republican Party or even from the Tea Party; our rights come from our Creator.
And the federal government’s role, the federal government’s responsibility is to defend those fundamental rights – to defend us.
And while Americans will continue to suffer under a president who has set an agenda that is causing millions to hurt across this country, I want to remind you of the promise of scripture. “Weeping may endure for a night, but joy cometh in the morning.”
Tonight, Iowa has proclaimed to the world “Morning is coming. Morning is coming.”
From day one, this campaign has been a movement for millions of Americans across this country to organize, to rally, to come together. Whatever Washington says they cannot keep the people down.
And tonight is a testament to the people’s commitments to their yearnings to get back to our core commitments, free market principles, constitutional liberties, and the Judeo-Christian values that built this great nation.
When the Washington lobbyists settled on other candidates in this race, when the media in one voice said a conservative cannot win, nationwide over 800,000 contributions poured in to TedCruz.org as courageous conservatives said “Yes, we can!”
800,000 contributions at TedCruz.org with an average contribution of $67. That is the power of the grassroots.
But it’s more than that. It’s 12,000 volunteers here in the state of Iowa. It’s over 200,000 volunteers all across this great nation.
You know, during the course of this campaign, people have asked Heidi and me, “Are you tired?” And I will admit, it is 16, 18 hours a day, six, seven days a week. We are not tired at all.
To the contrary we are inspired by each and every one of you.

I leap out of bed every morning amazed that at a time when our country is in crisis, every one of us has the opportunity to stand and lead that we have been put in a place of leadership for such a time as this.
I’m inspired by the stories of heroism that I see everyday. Working men like Jerry…[incomprehensible name] from Columbus, Ohio, who requested a month off his job to come to Iowa to live at Camp Cruz and to volunteer full-time. When his employer refused to give him the time off, Jerry quit his job and came anyway.
…And I love the great state of Iowa.
I’m inspired by people like [incomprehensible names]…students at the University of Chicago who spent their winter break at Camp Cruz. But they didn’t stop there. They came back this weekend, they hit the phones, and they hit the pavement campaigning so that students across this country upon graduation rather than having mountains of debts will instead have two, three, four, five high-paying job offers and a chance at the American dream.
I’m inspired by people like [incomprehensible name]…a 13-year-old girl from Lubbock, Texas, who yesterday at our campaign headquarters made 823 volunteer calls.
That has always been the strength of this campaign are the men and women gathered here and courageous conservatives standing up and speaking out and lifting us up in prayer and lifting this country up in prayer each and every day.

…You want to know what scares the Washington cartel? Actually not remotely. I don’t scare them in the tiniest bit. What scares them is you. What scares them is that the old Reagan coalition is coming back together of conservatives.
We’re saying conservatives and evangelicals and libertarians and Reagan Democrats all coming together as one and that terrifies Washington, D.C.
And so to the people of Iowa, Heidi and I say thank you for your incredible hospitality. Thank you for your love. Thank you for welcoming us into your homes, into your living rooms. Thank you for welcoming my father to preach from the pulpit of your churches.
And let me say to my parents – mom, thank you for the incredible unconditional love that you have given me everyday of my life, the knowledge that whatever I might do, whatever I might say that my mother loves.
…And to my dad, a man who came from Cuba at age 18 with nothing, with $100 in his underwear. He doesn’t carry money in his underwear anymore. A man who was imprisoned, who was tortured, who washed dishes making 50 cents an hour, who has lived the American dream. And a man who is today a pastor traveling the country preaching the gospel.
My dad is 76-years-old and yet he’s got the energy of a teenager. And dad, you have been a hero my whole life. I love you, dad.
When the sun rises tomorrow, this campaign will take the next step. We will continue to campaign the same way – sitting down person to person, leader to leader, VFW hall to Dunkin Donuts, returning to the great state of New Hampshire.
And let me speak for a minute to the men and women of the state of New Hampshire.
36 years ago, you welcomed to the Granite State a candidate running for president who was also deeply disliked by the Washington establishment and the Washington cartel. A candidate who had been dismissed outright by the media. Some polls had him 15 to 20 points behind.
But you refused to let the establishment and the cartel and the media do your thinking for you. You refused to let them tell you how to vote. You wanted a candidate who didn’t want to adopt his positions because of the latest opinion polls. But instead of a deep and underlying conservative philosophy that grounded him so that he knew exactly what he believed, exactly what the principles were that built this great nation.

…You want to know what scares the Washington cartel? Actually not remotely. I don’t scare them in the tiniest bit. What scares them is you. What scares them is that the old Reagan coalition is coming back together of conservatives.

And so tonight, I want to say to the people of New Hampshire, thank you for what you did 36 years ago. Thank you for giving America and the world and, yes, history itself our 40th president of the United States, Ronald Wilson Reagan.
And I ask the people of New Hampshire and the people of South Carolina and the people of Nevada and the people of the Super Tuesday states on March 1st, to each of you, do not listen to our words. Do not listen to the rhetoric from campaigns. But rather hold each and every one of us accountable – hold me accountable and hold every other candidate accountable – to be a consistent conservative.
If you want a candidate to repeal Obamacare, then support the candidate who has led the fight to repeal Obamacare.
If you want a president to stop amnesty, to secure the borders and keep us safe, then support a candidate who has led the fight to stop amnesty, to secure the borders, and to keep us safe.
If you want a candidate to support life and marriage and religious liberty, then support a candidate who has spent decades of his life fighting to defend life and marriage and religious liberty.
If you want a candidate to defend the Second Amendment right to keep and bear arms, then ask of every candidate where were you on the spring of 2013 when Barack Obama and Harry Reid and Chuck Schumer tried to undermine the Second Amendment right to keep and bear arms.
If you want a candidate who will stand unapologetically with the nation of Israel, then support a candidate who has led the fight over and over again to stand by our friend and ally the nation of Israel.
And if you want a commander-in-chief who will fulfill the most solemn obligation of the next president to keep this nation safe, then support a candidate who has demonstrated the commitment, the judgment, the experience, the clarity of vision to identify our enemy, to call it by its name – radical Islamic terrorism. And to utterly and completely defeat ISIS.
If I am elected president, every militant on the face of the planet will know if you go and join ISIS, if you wage jihad on the United States of America, if you attempt to murder innocent Americans, you are signing your death warrant.

And so tonight, I want to say to the people of New Hampshire, thank you for what you did 36 years ago. Thank you for giving America and the world and, yes, history itself our 40th president of the United States, Ronald Wilson Reagan.
And I ask the people of New Hampshire and the people of South Carolina and the people of Nevada and the people of the Super Tuesday states on March 1st, to each of you, do not listen to our words.

If you want a president to stop amnesty, to secure the borders and keep us safe, then support a candidate who has led the fight to stop amnesty, to secure the borders, and to keep us safe.
If you want a candidate to support life and marriage and religious liberty, then support a candidate who has spent decades of his life fighting to defend life and marriage and religious liberty.
If you want a candidate to defend the Second Amendment right to keep and bear arms, then ask of every candidate where were you on the spring of 2013 when Barack Obama and Harry Reid and Chuck Schumer tried to undermine the Second Amendment right to keep and bear arms.
If you want a candidate who will stand unapologetically with the nation of Israel, then support a candidate who has led the fight over and over again to stand by our friend and ally the nation of Israel.
And if you want a commander-in-chief who will fulfill the most solemn obligation of the next president to keep this nation safe, then support a candidate who has demonstrated the commitment, the judgment, the experience, the clarity of vision to identify our enemy, to call it by its name – radical Islamic terrorism. And to utterly and completely defeat ISIS.
If I am elected president, every militant on the face of the planet will know if you go and join ISIS, if you wage jihad on the United States of America, if you attempt to murder innocent Americans, you are signing your death warrant.

And I’ll tell you this: If the other states across the country follow the lead of the good men and women of Iowa and support this campaign, then I’ll tell you this – this July in Cleveland, you will hear these words spoken from the podium of the unified Republican convention.
Tonight, I want to say to every member of the Democratic Party who believes in limited government, in personal opportunity, the United States Constitution, and a safe and secure America, come home.
To the Reagan Democrats, your party has left you. And the Republican Party wants you. We welcome you back.
Because together this year, the Republicans and the Reagan Democrats can send an unmistakable message – the message of a Reagan-like landslide that once and for all will drive the liberal elites and the Washington cartel into the Potomac and out to sea never to be seen again.
Together, we can bring out a new era of economic growth, of military strength, of international security, and the future of hope that our children deserves.
If we commit to do more than hope, if we aspire to govern by a higher standard, a standard that transcends political party and race and gender and income, and to everyone that is tired of a president that divides us daily on racial lines, on ethnic lines, on religious lines, on gender lines, on socioeconomic lines, we will have a president that once again seeks to bring us together and unite us on our shared values of who we are as Americans.
The most solemn responsibility of the president is to keep this country safe and we will stop the weakness and appeasement. We will stop making excuses for global bullies and terrorists and rather simply do what it takes to defeat them.
I give you my solemn promise. We will finally, finally secure the borders and end sanctuary cities.
And I want to speak for a moment to the soldiers and sailors and airmen and marines, I want to speak to the moms and dads who have a child serving overseas, I want to speak to the husbands and wives who wake up at night wondering if their loved one is still alive, I want to speak to the little kids who have been waiting months upon months to get a hug from daddy and a kiss from mommy. To all our fighting men and women who have been sent into combat with their arms tied behind their back with rules of engagement that are wrong, that are immoral, that will end in January 2017.
You will have a commander-in-chief who finally has your back.
And to the police officers and the firemen and the first responders, the heroes who rush into burning buildings instead out of burning buildings, the last seven years of having a president, having an Attorney General that demonizes you, that vilifies you, that sides with the criminals and looters instead of the brave men and women of law enforcement, that will end on Jan. 20, 2017.

I wish them both luck.
But I will tell you this, as Margaret Thatcher observed, the problem with socialism is eventually you run out of other people’s money.
And let me tell you tonight, I cannot wait to stand on that debate stage with Hillary Clinton.
We will win by speaking the truth with a smile.
The truth is the American people are fed up with Washington, with a corrupt class that enriches itself and leaves behind the working men and women of this country.
The truth is the American people are fed up with a federal government that views the Bill of Rights and the Constitution as a rough draft, as an inconvenience, as something to be set aside, and we are ready to get back to the vision of the framers of protecting the unalienable rights given to each of us by our Creator.
You know, the reason all of you are here is the same reason I am here. It’s the same reason Heidi and I have spent every waking moment for the last year. We love our kids. Our girls, Caroline and Catherine, at age 7 and age 5.
Every one of us here when we go to bed at night we think what kind of world are we leaving our kids. Are we giving our children a brighter future? Are we giving our children what our parents gave us – a country with greater freedom, greater opportunity, more promise, more hope?
You want to know what I’m getting on a plane in about an hour and flying all night to New Hampshire to knock on doors and and sit down and visit with people and ask for their support? The reason is simple. Because when I look my girls in the eyes 10, 20 years from now, I’m not going to tell them “We could have stood up and saved this country but we didn’t do everything we could.” Instead, I’m going to tell them, “Millions of Americans saw that America was in jeopardy and we rose up together and said ‘We are going to preserve this nation for our children and grandchildren.’”
To those who supported other candidates in this race, the Republican Party is so blessed to have a bounty of talented, young, dynamic candidates, people who are our friends, people who I like respect. To those who supported other candidates, I will tell you each of them we welcome you as part of our team.
Because if we stand together as one, if the American people stand together and say “We want our country back”, there is no force in Washington that can stand against the American people, that can stand against the grassroots, that can stand against our unity. We’re going to do this together as a movement from the people.
And I’ll tell you tonight, Iowa has made clear to America and the world – morning is coming. Morning is coming.
Thank you and God bless you!

God bless the great state of South Carolina.
Friends, once again we have made history.
You the good people of South Carolina and our incredible volunteers all over the country continue to defy the pundits and to produce extraordinary results.
Let me say a word about Gov. Jeb Bush, a man who had a terrific record as governor of the state of Florida, who brought job creation and education innovation to the people of Florida, a man who ran a campaign based on ideas, based on policy, based on substance, a man who didn’t go to the gutter and engage in insults and attacks.
Gov. Bush brought honor and dignity to this race. Tonight, he has suspended his campaign but Heidi and I give our very best to Jeb and Columba and their entire extraordinary family. We wish them the best and we thank them for their remarkable campaign.
I want to thank our tremendous team here in South Carolina. Congressman Jeff Duncan. Congressman Mark Sanford. And former Attorney General Charlie Condon. Senator Lee Bright. And Representatives Bill Chumley and Wendy Nanney and Garry Smith and Mike Burns and Jay Jordan…
And the nearly 500 South Carolina pastors that endorsed and joined this campaign.
First Iowa, then New Hampshire, now South Carolina.
We don’t know the exact results right now. Right now, we are effectively tied for second place. But each time defying expectations and causing the pundits…
Indeed, the screaming you hear now from across the Potomac is the Washington cartel in full terror that the conservative grassroots are rising up.
But before we reflect on what we have together accomplished, I’d like to pause for a moment of silence in honor of a great man – an American hero – Justice Antonin Scalia.
Today, I attended Justice Scalia’s funeral. I had the honor of knowing him for 20 years. He was brilliant, principled, faithful, and a ferocious defender of the Constitution and the Bill of Rights.

Today, I attended Justice Scalia’s funeral. I had the honor of knowing him for 20 years. He was brilliant, principled, faithful, and a ferocious defender of the Constitution and the Bill of Rights.

As Ronald Reagan was to the presidency, so too was Justice Scalia to the U.S. Supreme Court.
His passing one week ago today underscores the enormous stakes of this election. It is not just one but two branches of government that are at stake.
And Justice Scalia’s replacement will not be decided by the Washington power brokers. It will be decided by we the people.
This election will be a referendum on the Supreme Court.
And I’ll tell you this: I cannot wait to stand on that debate stage with Hillary Clinton or Bernie Sanders or whatever other socialist they nominate and make the case against their radical vision of the Constitution that would strip away life and marriage and religious liberty and the Second Amendment and the basic rights of every American citizen.
In Iowa, they said it couldn’t be done and we won.
In New Hampshire, they said a conservative – a Bible-believing Christian – could not compete, and we defied expectations.
And tonight despite millions and millions of dollars of false and nasty attacks, despite the entirety of the political establishment coming together against us, South Carolina has given us another remarkable result.
Together, Iowa, New Hampshire, and South Carolina tell us three things.
First, that conservatives continue to unite behind our campaign. If you are a conservative this is where you belong because only one strong conservative is in a position to win this race.
Second, we are the only campaign that has beaten and can beat Donald Trump. That’s why Donald relentlessly attacks us and ignores all the other candidates.
Now I congratulate Donald on his victory tonight but I will say this to the people of America: If you don’t believe that Donald Trump is the best candidate to run against Hillary Clinton in November, if you believe we need a strong contrast with the Democrats, then we welcome you aboard our team. We welcome you to be part of the over 200,000 volunteers and the over 980,000 volunteer contributions at TedCruz.org. Join us at TedCruz.org.

And the third lesson of Iowa, New Hampshire and South Carolina is that only one candidate remaining has a consistent conservative record.
Other candidates engage in non-stop personal attacks. We have not and we will not respond in kind.
There is a reason other candidates resort to insults and it is that they cannot defend the substance of their record.
There is only one candidate who has led the fight against amnesty, who has led the fight against Obamacare, who has led the fight to defend life and marriage and religious liberty, who has led the fight to protect our right to keep and bear arms under the Second Amendment, who will fight to pass a simple flat tax and abolish the IRS.
Only one candidate has stood up to the corrupt dealmaking in Washington, said no to the corporate welfare. And indeed, only one candidate took on the methanol mandate in Iowa and won.
As president, I will rebuild our military, stand unequivocally with the nation of Israel, and utterly destroy ISIS. Together, we will secure the borders and keep America safe.
And I give you my solemn word that every justice I appoint to the U.S. Supreme Court will be a principled constitutionalist who will be faithful and will vigorously protect the fundamental rights of our children and grandchildren.
When I look at our young daughters, Caroline and Catherine, I know that I will fight with every breadth in my body to ensure that they enjoy the same fundamental liberties that all of us have been blessed to inherit.
It’s why I fight. It’s why everyone here fights. Because we love our children and we will not go quietly into the night and give up on a brighter America.
And now the race turns to Nevada and to Super Tuesday and the so-called SEC primary.
And Iowa, New Hampshire, and South Carolina have given the voters a clear defined choice. You can go with Washington dealmakers or we can stand together with a proven, consistent, constitutional conservative and bring back morning in America.
Each of you is amazing and together we will win the Republican nomination. We will beat the Democrats in November. And we will restore this last best hope of mankind that is the United States of America.
Thank you and God bless you!

God bless the great state of Wisconsin!
What an incredible victory tonight, and thank you to your tremendous governor, Gov. Scott Walker, for his principled compassionate leadership.
Tonight is a turning point. It is a rallying cry.
It is a call from the hardworking men and women of Wisconsin to the people of America: We have a choice – a real choice.
The national political terrain began to change two weeks ago.
In the state of Utah, we won 69% of the vote – a landslide election. Winning every single delegate in the state.
Then just three days ago in Colorado, two congressional districts voted. Once again, they elected six delegates and of those six delegates, we won all six.
And then two days in North Dakota, we had another tremendous win. They elected their delegates. Of the delegates who specified their support, 18 are supporting our campaign; one is supporting Donald Trump.
18 to one. I’ll take a ratio any day of the week.
And now tonight, here in Wisconsin, a state that just three weeks ago, the media had written off – three weeks ago the media said Wisconsin was a perfect state for Donald Trump.
But the hardworking men and women of Wisconsin stood and campaigned tirelessly to make sure that tonight was a victory for every American.
Four very different states – Utah, Colorado, North Dakota, Wisconsin – four victories.
So just how significant is tonight? Well, just today, our campaign has raised over $2 million.
People all over the country going to TedCruz.org, TedCruz.org, TedCruz.org, contributing $10 or $25 or $50. We’ve had over 1.3 million contributions.
In the last two weeks and in the coming days when Colorado and Wyoming finish voting, we are likely to have gained over 100 delegates on Donald Trump.
And as a result of tonight, as a result of the people of Wisconsin defying the media, defying the pundits, I am more and more convinced that our campaign is going to earn the 1,237 delegates needed to win the nomination.
Either before Cleveland or at the convention in Cleveland, together we will win a majority of the delegates and together we will beat Hillary Clinton in November.
Tonight was a bad night for Hillary Clinton. It was a bad night in the Democratic primary, and it was even a worse night for her in the Republican primary.
We are winning because we’re uniting the Republican Party.
Of the 17 candidates who started this race, a terrific talented dynamic field, five have now endorsed this campaign.

Rick Perry and Lindsey Graham and Jeb Bush and Carly Fiorina and Wisconsin’s own Gov. Scott Walker.
When you toss in Sen. Mike Lee and Mark Levin, we’ve got the full spectrum of the Republican Party coming together and uniting behind this campaign.
In 1960, accepting the Democratic Party’s nomination, John F. Kennedy observed, “I think the American people expect more from us than cries of indignation and attack. The times are too grave, the challenge too urgent and the stakes too high to permit the customary passions of political debate. We are not here to curse the darkness but to light the candle that can guide us to see through that darkness to a safe and sane future.”
As Winston Churchill said on taking office, “If we open a quarrel between the present and the past, we shall be in danger of losing the future.”
The same is true today.
Tonight, Wisconsin has lit a candle guiding the way forward. Tonight, we once again have hope for the future.
Tonight is about unity, and tonight is about hope.
Young people in America once again have hope that we will bring jobs back to America.
By repealing Obamacare, reining in the federal regulators that are killing small businesses, passing a flat tax and abolishing the IRS, we will unleash incredible economic growth.
Our border will finally be made secure and sanctuary cities will end.
Truck drivers and mechanics and plumbers and steel workers, union members, men and women with callouses on their hands will once again see wages rising, opportunity expanding.

Working moms, struggling to make ends meet, will see take home pay rising, the cost of living falling, and Common Core empty.
Catholic Schools and Jewish Day Schools, Brigham Young and the Little Sisters of the Poor will…support that protects their religious liberty.
The fundamental freedom of every one of us to live according to our faith and our conscience.
We’ll see a Supreme Court that protects the Second Amendment right to keep and bear arms and our fundamental right to protect our family and hour homes and our children.
We’ll see a president who stands with Israel clearly and unapologetically.
Instead of negotiating with terrorists, we’ll rip to shred this catastrophic Iranian nuclear deal.
We will defeat radical Islamic terrorism, and we will utterly destroy ISIS. We will have a president who keeps us safe.
To the soldiers and sailors, the airmen and marines, to the police officers and firefighters and first responders who risk their lives everyday to keep us safe, we will have a commander-in-chief who has your back.
Jobs, freedom, and security – that’s what this next election is all about.
In 1980, Milton Rose Friedman wrote “Free to Choose”. They explained that the American free enterprise system has been the greatest engine for opportunity and prosperity that the world has ever seen.
Too much government can stifle opportunity. But if we get Washington out of the way, then there is no limit to what we can accomplish.
It’s what allowed my dad to escape Cuba and come to America with nothing, washing dishes, making 50 cents a day to start a business and today to be a pastor traveling the country.
It’s allowed my Irish-Italian mom to become the first in her family to go to college, to smash glass ceilings by becoming a pioneering computer programmer.
It’s what allowed my wife Heidi…I may be biased. But isn’t she going to make an amazing First Lady?

She’s the child of missionaries. My best friend in the world and she’s become a successful business leader, a loving mom, and everyday she’s teaching our daughters, Caroline and Catherine, that strong women can accomplish anything in the United States.
That’s America. It’s what we’re fighting for – our children, our future.
And as Wisconsin has made clear, we are free to choose.
For centuries, America has been a shining city on the hill, a beacon of liberty to the world. And we can and will be once again.
So I ask you at home to join us as we continue to unite Republicans and independents and libertarians and Reagan Democrats and Americans who care about our future, who want jobs, freedom and security. Just as we’ve done in Wisconsin we’re doing all across this country.
And governor, let me tell you, I look forward to coming back to the state of Wisconsin this fall.
And in November for the first time since 1984, painting the Badger State bright Republican red.
So let me just say, Hillary, get ready, here we come.
God bless you!

God bless the great state of Indiana.
Elections are about choices. The Republican Party faces a choice today.
Indiana and America, I believe, want to unite behind a positive, optimistic forward-looking conservative campaign based on real policies…to the problems facing this country.
And the American people deserve a real choice in November.
A choice and not an echo. A meaningful distinction.
If we come to November and the American are given a choice between two big government liberals, two Washington insiders enmeshed in the corruption of Washington, then we as Republican Party will have failed the American people.
And I will tell you when you run for president, one of the most solemn choices you make is the choice of selecting a vice presidential candidate.
This is a choice that you are telling the American people this is an individual who I trust and even more importantly this is an individual you can trust to lead this country no matter what might happen.
Any responsible candidate for president would have spent much time assessing possible candidates, thinking through the pros and cons, studying who these people are, praying about it, and examining the potential candidates.
And you know, the characteristics that you look for in a vice president are indeed the very same characteristics you look for in a president.
First of all, knowledge. Do they know enough to do the job? Do they know where jobs come from? Do they understand why jobs are leaving America? Do they understand why manufacturing jobs are being driven overseas? Do they understand why Carrier has left Indiana and gone to Mexico? Do they understand what is happening in the economy and government? Do they understand the Constitution and Bill of Rights? Are these words on a paper or are these promises that protect our fundamental right?
And security. Do they understand the threats facing us in the world? The threats that potentially endanger your children and mine.
That’s the first criteria you look to as knowledge. Does this person have the experience and knowledge to do the job?

God bless the great state of Indiana.

And security. Do they understand the threats facing us in the world? The threats that potentially endanger your children and mine.
That’s the first criteria you look to as knowledge. Does this person have the experience and knowledge to do the job?

Secondly, you look to judgment. Do they have the judgment and wisdom to bear the mantle of a job whose responsibilities have grayed the hair of every person ever to hold that office?
Do they think through decisions in a rash and impulsive way?
Do they pop off the handle at whatever strikes them at any given moment? Or do they think through careful, measured?
Do they assemble a team around them who are smarter than they are? You know, there’s an old adage in management that As hire As and Bs hire Cs.
If you see a leader who deliberately surrounds himself with people who are not capable, who are not informed, who are not skilled and who would never, ever, ever stand up to that leader, it tells you that leader is not a leader but someone not at all secure in who they are.
And the third thing you look to is character. Are they honest? Do they have core principles that come from their gut are not a momentary dalliance announced today to be abandoned tomorrow? But do they know who they are when they look into the mirror? Is it based on whatever the media tells them that given day, whatever the fad is that given moment, whatever is trending on Twitter? Or do they have a foundation?
And integral to character, how do they treat others? How do they treat others, especially those they don’t have to be nice to.
You know, everyone knows how to kiss up. Everyone can be nice to their boss. That is not a complicated skill. But how do they treat the clerk at the convenience store? How do they treat the average man and woman? How do they treat the American citizen? How do they treat the vulnerable?
That reveals everything you need to know about character.
After a great deal of time and thought, after a great deal of consideration and prayer, I have come to the conclusion that if I am nominated to be president of the United States that I will run on a ticket with my vice presidential nominee, Carly Fiorina.
Born in Texas, the very first thing I liked about her, Carol Carleton Fiorina known throughout the country simply by the name of Carly is an extraordinary leader.
She started working as a secretary in a small firm. And she climbed the corporate ladder to become the CEO of the largest technology company in the world.

She started working as a secretary in a small firm. And she climbed the corporate ladder to become the CEO of the largest technology company in the world.

And the first female CEO in the history of a Fortune 20 company.
A graduate of Stanford and MIT, Carly is brilliant and capable and yet she experienced the hard scrabble world of being a woman professional in a business world that extracts a price.
I say that as a son of a pioneering computer programmer – my mother who started in the computer industry in the 1950s. I say that as the husband of my wife Heidi Cruz, who spent two decades in the business industry.
Over and over again, Carly has shattered glass ceilings.
But in addition to being a woman of extraordinary intelligence, she is also a woman of deep principle. She’s served as the chairman of the American Conservative Foundation, championing conservative principles on a national level.
She has studied the threats facing our national security, serving as the Chairman of the CIA’s External Advisory Board.
And if you look to the criteria I laid out, let’s start number one with knowledge. She knows from having spent a lifetime how to produce jobs, how to expand jobs, how to raise wages.
She knows firsthand that the key to economic growth is not government and more and more government, it is rather less and less government.
My opponent in this race, Donald Trump, like Hillary Clinton and Bernie Sanders looks to government as the answer to every problem.
Carly knows firsthand from decades in the business world running one of the 20 largest corporations in America where jobs come from.
And she respects the Constitution and Bill of Rights. They are not – you know, if a candidate views the Bill of Rights as an occasional inconvenience – something to be talked about one day and ignored the next – if a candidate views religious liberty as something to be cast aside when it’s inconvenient, if a candidate views the Second Amendment right to keep and bear arms is merely a suggestion, they don’t have the grounding to be president.
Carly respects the Constitution and the Bill of Rights and she understands the threats facing America. She understands this is a dangerous world.
And in naming her as my vice presidential nominee, I am also telling you that she is someone you can be confident in if the occasion should arise to be commander in chief and keep this country safe.
We need a president who isn’t neutral between Israel and the Palestinians.
We need a president who will not keep in place this Iranian nuclear deal but who will rip it to shreds.

We need a president who will not keep in place this Iranian nuclear deal but who will rip it to shreds.

And the second criteria – judgment. You know, it was seven weeks ago today that Carly endorsed our campaign.
When Carly initially endorsed, before that announcement, she and I sat down and talked at great lengths.
And one of the things that struck me in that conversation – she said, “I have a condition for endorsement.” I kind of sat back and said, “All right. What is that?” She said, “I don’t do anything halfway. If I endorse, I want to be all in. I want to be campaigning. I want to be working. I want to be doing everything I can to make the case to the American people.”
That’s the kind of condition you’d like to hear.
Her condition was “My endorsement is not just an empty rubber stamp. A one momentary fluff in the wind. It is rather a full commitment.” Because Carly looked at me and said, “Our country is in crisis and we’ve got to do this together.”
And since that time, I have seen her day in and day out on the campaign bus going from stop to stop to stop that she is careful. She is measured. She is serious.
She doesn’t get overly excited. She doesn’t get rattled by whatever is getting thrown at.
And you know, we all saw that when in one of the earliest debates, Carly confronted Donald Trump. A man who in his characteristic understatement said of her, “Look at that face.”
And everyone of us remembers the grace, the class, the élan in which Carly responded. Responded to Donald that she knew exactly what he knew exactly what he was saying and that every woman in America knew exactly what Donald Trump was saying.
You know, one of the great principles of bullies – they feed off of fear. They feed off of people who would cower in the corner when they yell and scream and insult and holler and curse and they don’t know what to do when a strong, powerful woman stands up and says “I am not afraid.”
The third characteristic that is also important for a president is character. At the end of the day, it’s all about character.
If the president is a no good scoundrel, if the president is a narcissist, if the president is abusive and angry, they will not and cannot be a good president.
And for anyone we need only look to the past seven years to see what happens.
And a good president must have known struggle. Must be able to understand those who are struggling. If you’ve always lived a life of privilege, if you’ve always been told you are the chosen one, that has real impacts on the job you could do as president.
When Carly started as a secretary in a small firm in an environment in a business world that was not always welcoming to women, she knew and knows what it’s like to struggle in the workplace each and everyday.
But she’s also faced personal struggle, including being diagnosed with breast cancer. Battling cancer and surviving cancer.

But she’s also faced personal struggle, including being diagnosed with breast cancer. Battling cancer and surviving cancer.

As a son who was by my mother’s side when she battled breast cancer, I know first hand how devastating that disease could be and I know what a testament it is to her strength and grit and fortitude that she came roaring back, ready to conquer the world.
Carly has known tragedy, including the loss of her step-daughter to a drug overdose.
There is no pain on the face of the planet commensurate with the pain of a parent losing a child.
And Carly has struggled through that and going through the personal struggles. Everyone here has faced personal struggles but it is when you are facing the void, when you are facing the abyss that you find your character, you find who you are, you find your faith, you find your ground.
Maybe that’s why Carly isn’t intimidated by bullies because she’s faced challenges a lot worse than someone bellowing and yellowing and insulting her face.
Let me tell you on a personal level, Heidi and I have become friends with Carly. We’ve spent time with her on the campaign trail. We’ve laughed. We’ve watched basketball games together. We have marveled at this crazy, wild journey.
And I’ll tell you, our girls – Caroline and Catherine – have come to adore Carly.
On the bus on the campaign trail, Carly makes up songs and sings them to Caroline and Catherine. And our girls, mind you, they’re eight and five, both regularly text Carly.
And let me tell you, Carly may become the first vice president in history to have a very, impressive fluency with heart and smiley face emoticons. And when you’re texting with a five-year-old girl or an eight-year-old girl, those are highly valuable.
Now, listen, some might ask why now. It’s tradition that a vice presidential nominee is announced at the convention. It is unusual to make the announcement as early as we’re doing so now.
Well, I think all would acknowledge this race, if anything, it is unusual.
Where we are now the mainstream media, the New York media executives, and the Washington lobbyists, are all trying to tell the American people the race is over.
But let me tell you where we are right now. Where we are right now, nobody is getting to 1,237 delegates.
I’m not getting to 1,237 delegates, and Donald J. Trump is not getting to 1,237 delegates.
And the Hoosier state is going to have a powerful voice in making that clear.
So why make this announcement now? Well, for one thing, if we are to win, number one win the nomination but number two even more importantly win the general election, we must unite.
And Carly is a vice presidential nominee who I believe is superbly skilled, superbly gifted at helping unite this party, bring us together so we stand united as one.

And Carly is a vice presidential nominee who I believe is superbly skilled, superbly gifted at helping unite this party, bring us together so we stand united as one.

Secondly, I make this announcement today so that you the voters – the voters in Indiana, the voters in Nebraska, the voters in South Dakota and Washington state, and California and across the country – so that you will know what you will get.
The voters deserve to know – you deserve to have a candidate who doesn’t change as the wind blows in any given moment. You deserve to know exactly where our candidates stand.
The final reason for making the decision now is to give the American people a clear choice. Elections are about choices.
You know, across this country, millions of Americans are struggling with an economy that isn’t working, with the Obama-Clinton economy that is stagnant, are seeing the Bill of Rights under assault – religious liberty, the Second Amendment violated by the federal government, a Supreme Court hanging in the balance, a president who abandons our friends and allies, whether it is Great Britain or whether it is Israel.
And a president who is unwilling to stand up to confront radical Islamic terrorism and defeat ISIS.
Some in the media will say, “Wouldn’t it be easier just to throw up your hands and say surrender?”
Donald Trump has won some of the races so we should step back and let him win them all.
If we nominate a candidate who is a big government New York liberal, who is a Washington insider, who agrees with Hillary Clinton and Barack Obama on issue after issue after issue, and whose lobbyist campaign manager has told us “He is only playing a part. This is only a role”, he is lying to us, then we as a Republican Party would have failed profoundly for this country because the men and women of Indiana know if we get people a clear choice between freedom and tyranny, between prosperity and poverty, between vulnerability and weakness and peace through strength that the American people will choose the Constitution and jobs and freedom and security over and over again.
The difference between Carly and me on the one side and Donald Trump and Hillary Clinton on the other side could not be starker.
If you want someone that will stand and fight for the working men and women of this country, fight for the men and women with callouses on your hand, fight for the single moms, fight for the young people, fight for those who are struggling and want to achieve the American dream, then do not go with the Washington insiders who have sold us down the river.
This ticket is about the future. It is about our children. It is about our grandchildren. The stakes of this election – we are not simply wagering on a sporting contest. We are involved in a fight that every one of us is privileged to be here to be fighting to save the greatest country in the history of the world, to make sure that the next generation has every bit as much freedom and opportunity as each of us was blessed to have.
And with that, I am pleased to introduce to you an extraordinary leader, my friend, and the next vice president of the United States Carly Fiorina.

God bless the Hoosier state.
Let me tell you about the America that I love.
Our nation is an exceptional nation. We were founded by risk takers and pioneers. Brave men and women who put everything on the line for freedom.
We began with a revolutionary idea that our rights don’t come from kings or queens or even presidents but from God Almighty.
That every one of us has an unalienable right to life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness.
And that to protect those rights, the Constitution serves as change to bind the mischief of government.
For more than two centuries, we have protected those rights. We believe in equal rights for everybody.
That everybody deserves dignity and respect, whether they agree with you or not.
That there will always be evil in the world and injustice in the world but America stands up to it and confronts it.
Even from a Montgomery jail, our voice for justice and equality rings out for the ages.
America is hopeful, optimistic. America is kind. We’re not boastful or mean-spirited.
America is brave. We keep our word. And we believe in peace through strength.
We have spilled more blood, spent more treasure in defense of liberty than any country in history.
Yet, we do not engage in wars of conquest. We do not seek to enrich ourselves at our neighbor’s expense.
America is the land that gave my mom, an Irish-Italian girl growing up in a working class family, the chance to be the first in her family ever to go to college, to become a pioneering computer programmer in the 1950s.
I love you, mom.
America is the land that welcome my father, [a Cuban] immigrant…He’s seen oppression, prison, and torture in Cuba. And for him, America was hope. It was opportunity.
In 1957, if someone had told that teenager washing dishes for 50 cents an hour that one day his son would be elected to the Senate and he would get a chance to cast his ballot for his son to be president of the United States, that teenage immigrant washing dishes could never have believed it. And yet, that’s exactly what happened. Only in America.
God bless the Hoosier state.

And yet, that’s exactly what happened. Only in America.

In recent months, a lot of people have been talking about what happened 40 years ago at the Republican Convention in Kansas City – our party’s last contested convention.
When I look back at that convention in Missouri, I think of the speech that Ronald Reagan gave to our party. He spoke not of the next four years. He saw not of the close horizons that are of interest to those who seek to build their own fortunes in the short-term. But instead he looked to the distant times that concern the men and women whose purpose it is to secure the blessings of liberty to their posterity.
Ronald Reagan spoke of the next 100 years and of the generations of Americans who would come to know whether our nation had escaped the existential threat of nuclear war, who would know whether our party had succeeded in its fight against the erosion of constitutional freedoms that only grow and multiple under rule of the Democratic Party.
Ronald Reagan spoke of the purpose that defined our party then and that must unite and drive our party now.
The Republican Party of Ronald Reagan and of George Herbert Walker Bush ensured that thousands of nuclear missiles that the Soviet Union and the United States have targeted each other were never fired and that Soviet communism was consigned to the ash heap of history.
They fought hard so that our American freedoms were not lost to any foreign foe nor sacrificed in pursuit of any domestic agenda of the Democratic Party.
Yet, the challenges we face today remain as great as ever.
Americans are deeply frustrated and desperately want to change the path that we’re on.
We have economic stagnation at home and our constitutional rights are under assault.
Under the Obama-Clinton foreign policy, Russia has emerged as a resurgent threat. China looks with a covetous eye on the lands of our allies in the region. A nuclear North Korea and a near nuclear Iran yearn to devastate our homeland. And radical Islamic terrorism unleashes an evil that threatens the world.
This year, two weeks before our party gather in Cleveland, all Americans will celebrate the 240th birthday of the United States of America.
American parents and grandparents will watch the firework with their kids and will dream of the grandchildren and great grandchildren to come and will wonder how those future generations of Americans will remember what we do not only this summer but in the coming decades.
Will we rise to meet the challenges that face our nation on the international stage or will we withdraw and cower timidly from the world?
Will we secure freedom of thought, expression, and religion for future generations or will we succumb to the tyranny of the political correctness and the temptation of racial politics and balkanization here at home?
Will we hold fast to our founding values of rewarding talent, hard work and industry?
Or will we continue on that path of creeping socialism that incentivizes apathy and dependency?
Will we deliver control of health care to citizens and their doctors? Or will we continue down the Obamacare road to second rate socialized medicine?

Will we keep America safe from the threat of nuclear war and atomic terrorism?
Or will we pass on to future generations a land devastated and destroyed by the enemies of civilization?
This is the responsibility with which we have been charged by history.
This is our challenge. This is the fight that falls to our generation.
When we launched this campaign 13 months ago, we saw a movement grow. The pundits all said it was hopeless. But we saw over 300,000 volunteers all across this nation.
Over 1.5 million contributions averaging about $60 each.
Many of those volunteers, many of those contributions, you’d never forget.
Just a few days ago, two young kids ages 4 and 6 handed me two envelopes full of change – all of their earnings from their lemonade stand. They wanted the campaign to have it.
That’s what built this campaign. That’s what fueled this movement.
Thank you to each of you, incredible patriots, who have fought so hard to save our nation.
And I with you. I am so grateful to you.
To my amazing wife, Heidi, to our precious girls, Caroline and Catherine, to my mom, the prayer warrior, to my dad, who has traveled this nation preaching the gospel, to Carly Fiorina who has been an incredible, phenomenal running mate.
What you have done, the movement that you have started is extraordinary. I love each and every one of you.
From the beginning, I’ve said that I would continue on as long as there was a viable path to victory. Tonight, I’m sorry to say it appears that path has been foreclosed.
Together, we left it all on the field in Indiana. We gave it everything we’ve got. But the voters chose another path.
And so with a heavy heart but with boundless optimism for the long-term future of our nation, we are suspending our campaign.

But hear me now, I am not suspending our fight for liberty.
I am not suspending our fight to defend the Constitution, to defend the Judeo-Christian values that built America.
Our movement will continue. And I give you my word that I will continue this fight with all of my strength and all of my ability.
You are extraordinary and we will continue to fight next week and next month and next year. And together we will continue as long as God grants us the strength to fight on.
For one thing remains as true today as it was 40 years ago in Kansas City, in this fight for the long-term future of America, there is no substitute for victory.
There is no substitute for the America that each and every one of us loves with all of our heart, that we believe in with all of our heart, and that together, we will restore as a shining city on the hill for every generation to come.
Thank you to each of you and God bless you!

Heidi and I are so honored to join you here in Cleveland, where LeBron James just led an incredible comeback victory.
And I am convinced that America is going to come back too.
I want to congratulate Donald Trump on winning the nomination last night.
And like each of you, I want to see the principles that our party believes prevail in November.
Conventions are times of excitement, but given the events of the last few weeks I hope you’ll allow me a moment to talk to you about what’s really at stake.
Just two weeks ago, a nine-year-old girl named Caroline was having a carefree Texas summer – swimming in the pool, playing with friends, doing all the things a happy child might do.
Like most children, she relied upon the love that she received from her mom, Heidi and her dad, a police sergeant named Michael Smith. That is until he became one of the five police officers gunned down in Dallas.
The day her father was murdered, Caroline gave him a hug and a kiss as he left for work. But as they parted, her dad asked her something he hadn’t asked before: “What if this is the last time you ever kissed or hugged me?”
Later, as she thought of her fallen father and that last heartbreaking hug, Caroline broke down in tears. How could anything ever be okay again?
Michael Smith was a former Army Ranger who spent three decades with the Dallas Police Department. I have no idea who he voted for in the last election or what he thought about this one. But his life was a testament to devotion.
He protected the very protesters who mocked him because he loved his country and his fellow man.
His work gave new meaning to that line from literature, “To die of love is to live by it”.
As I thought about what I wanted to say tonight, Michael Smith’s story weighed on my heart.
Maybe that’s because his daughter Caroline is about the same age as my eldest daughter and happens to share the same name.
Maybe it’s because I saw a video of that dear sweet child choking back sobs as she remembered her daddy’s last question to her.
Maybe it’s because we live in a world where so many others have had their lives destroyed by evil in places like Orlando and Paris and Nice and Baton Rouge.
Maybe it’s because of the simple question itself – what if this right now is our last time? Our last moment to do something for our families and our country.
Did we live up to the values we say we believe? Did we do all we really could? That’s really what elections should be about.
That’s why you and millions like you devoted so much time and sacrifice to this campaign.
We’re fighting not for one particular candidate or one campaign but because each of us wants to be able to tell our kids and grandkids – our own Carolines – that we did our best for their future and our country.

America is more than just a land mass between two oceans.
America is an ideal – simple yet powerful idea: freedom matters.
For much of human history, government power has been the unavoidable constant in life.
Government decrees and the people obey.
But not here. We have no king or queen. We have no dictator. We the people constrain government.
Our nation is exceptional because it was built on the five most beautiful and powerful words in the English language: I want to be free.
Never has that message been more needed than today.
We stand here tonight, a nation divided. Partisan ranker, anger, even hatred are tearing America apart.
And citizens are furious, rightly furious, at a political establishment that cynically breaks its promises and that ignores the will of the people.
We have to do better. We owe our fallen heroes more than that.
Now, of course, Obama and Clinton will also tell you that they care about our children’s future.
And I want to believe them but there is a profound difference in our two parties’ vision for the future.
Theirs is a party that thinks ISIS is a JV team, that responds to the deaths of Americans in Benghazi by asking “What difference does it make?” And that thinks it’s possible to make a deal with Iran which celebrates as holidays Death to America Day and Death to Israel Day.
My friends, this is madness.
President Obama is a man who does everything backward. He wants to close Guantanamo Bay and open up our borders. He exports jobs and imports terrorists. Enough is enough.
And I am here to tell you there is a better vision for our future, a return to freedom.
On education, your freedom to choose your child’s education, even if you aren’t as rich as Hillary Clinton or Barack Obama.
On healthcare, your freedom to choose your own doctor without Obamacare.
On taxes, your freedom to provide for your family without the IRS beating down your door.

The internet, keep it free from taxes, free from regulation, and don’t give it away to Russia and China.
Freedom means free speech, not politically correct safe spaces.
Freedom means religious freedom, whether you are Christian or Jew, Muslim or atheist.
Whether you are gay or straight, the Bill of Rights protects the rights of all of us to live according to our conscience.
Freedom means the right to keep and bear arms and to protect your family.
Freedom means that every human life is precious and must be protected.
Freedom means Supreme Court justices who don’t dictate policy but instead follow the Constitution.
And freedom means recognizing that our Constitution allows states to choose policies that reflect local values.
Colorado might decide something different than Texas. New York different than Iowa. That’s the way it’s supposed to be – diversity. If not, what’s the point of having states to begin with?
Now, Hillary Clinton believes that government should make virtually every choice in your life – education, health care, marriage, speech, all dictated out of Washington.
But something powerful is happening. We’ve seen it in both parties. We’ve seen it in the United Kingdom’s unprecedented Brexit vote to leave the European Union.
Voters are overwhelmingly rejecting the political establishment and overwhelmingly rejecting big government. That is a profound victory and it is one earned by each and every one of you.
People are fed up with politicians who don’t listen to them, fed up with a corrupt system that benefits the elites instead of working men and women.
We deserve an immigration system that puts America first, and yes, builds a wall to keep America safe. A government, a government that stops admitting ISIS terrorists as refugees.

We deserve trade policies that put the interests of American farmers and manufacturing job over the global interests that are funding the lobbyists.
And if we stand together and choose freedom, our future will be brighter.
Freedom will bring back jobs and raise wages.
Freedom will lift people out of dependency to the dignity of work.
We can do this. Forty-seven years ago to this day, America put the very first man on the moon. That was the power of freedom.
Our party, the Republican Party, was founded to defeat slavery.
Abraham Lincoln, the first Republican President, signed the Emancipation Proclamation.
Together we passed the Civil Rights Act and together fought to eliminate Jim Crow laws.
That’s our collective legacy although the media will never share it with you.
Those were fights for freedom and so is this.
Sergeant Michael Smith stood up to protect our freedom and so do the soldiers and sailors and airmen and marines every day fighting radical Islamic terrorism.
And so did the family of Alton Sterling who bravely [inaudible]…the violence. So did the family of those murdered at the Charleston Emanuel AME Church who forgave that hateful, bigoted murderer. And so can we.
We deserve leaders who stand for principle, who unite us all behind shared values, who cast aside anger for love. That is the standard we should expect from everybody.
And to those listening, please, don’t stay home in November.

If you love our country and love your children as much as I know that you do, stand and speak and vote your consciences, vote for candidates up and down the ticket who you trust to defend our freedom and to be faithful to the Constitution.
I appreciate the enthusiasm of the New York delegation.
And I will tell you, it is love of freedom that has allowed millions to achieve their dreams.
Like my mom, the first in her family to go to college, and my dad who’s here tonight, who fled prison and torture in Cuba coming to Texas with just $100 sewn into his underwear.
And it is love that I hope will bring comfort to a grieving nine-year-old girl in Dallas and, God willing, propel her to move forward and dream and soar and make her daddy proud.
We must make the most of our moments to fight for freedom, to protect our God-given rights even if those with whom we don’t agree so that when we are old and gray and when our work is done and we give those we love one final kiss goodbye, we will be able to say that freedom matters and I was part of something beautiful.
The case we have to make to the American people, the case each person in this room has to make to the American people is to commit to each of them that we will defend freedom and be faithful to the Constitution.
We will unite the party. We will unite the country by standing together for shared values, by standing for liberty.
God bless each and every one of you, and God bless the United States of America.
