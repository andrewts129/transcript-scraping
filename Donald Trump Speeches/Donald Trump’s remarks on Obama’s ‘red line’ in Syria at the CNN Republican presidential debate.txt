Number one, I wouldn’t have drawn the line but once he drew it, he had no choice but to go across. They do bear some responsibility but I think he’d probably didn’t do it not for that reason.
Somehow he just doesn’t have courage. There’s something missing from our president.
Had he crossed the line and really gone in with force and had done something to Assad – if he had gone in there with tremendous force, you wouldn’t have millions of people displaced all over the world.
…I think they [the Senators who voted against authorizing Obama to use force against Assad] had a responsibility. Absolutely. I think we have three of them here. I think they had a responsibility.
