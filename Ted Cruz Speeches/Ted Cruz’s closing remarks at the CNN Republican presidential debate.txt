Ronald Reagan believed in America. If I’m elected President, our friends and allies across the globe will know that we stand with them.
The bust of Winston Churchill will be back in the Oval Office and the American Embassy in Israel will be in Jerusalem.
Enemies across this world will know the United States is not to be trifled with.
ISIS will be defeated. We will have a President willing to utter the words radical Islamic terrorism, and the Ayatollah Khomeini will understand that he will never, ever ever acquire nuclear weapons.
Here at home, we’ll reignite the promise of America.
Young people coming out of school with student loans up to their eyeballs will find instead of no jobs two, three, four, five job opportunities. How will that happen?
Through tax reform. We’ll pass a simple flat tax and abolish the IRS.
And through regulatory reform. We will repeal every word of Obamacare.
You want to know what I’ll do as President? It’s real simple. We’ll kill the terrorists. We’ll repeal Obamacare. And we will defend the Constitution every single word of it.
