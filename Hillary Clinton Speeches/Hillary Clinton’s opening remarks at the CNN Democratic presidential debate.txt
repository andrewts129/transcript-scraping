…I’m Hillary Clinton. I have been proud and privileged to serve as First Lady, as a senator from New York, and as Secretary of State.
I’m the granddaughter of a factory worker and a grandmother of a wonderful one-year-old child.
And everyday, I think about what we need to do to make sure that opportunity is available not just for her but for all of our children.
I have spent a very long time – my entire adult life – looking for ways to even the odds to help people have a chance to get ahead and in particular to find the ways for each child to live up to his or her God-given potential.
I’ve traveled across our country over the last months listening and learning.
And I’ve put forward specific plans about how we’re going to create more good-paying jobs by investing in infrastructure and clean energy, by making it possible once again to invest in science and research, and taking the opportunities posed by climate change to grow our economy.
At the center of my campaign is how we’re going to raise wages. Yes, of course, raise the minimum wage, but we have to do so much more, including finding ways so that companies share profits with the workers who help to make them.
And then we have to figure out how we make the tax system a fairer one. Right now, the wealthy pay too little, and the middle class pays too much. So I have specific recommendations about how we’re going to close those loopholes, make it clear that the wealthy will have to pay their fair share and have a series of tax cuts for middle class families.
And I want to do more to help us balance family and work. I believe in equal pay for equal work for women. But I also believe it’s about time we have paid family leave for American families and join the rest of the world.
During the course of the evening tonight, I’ll have a chance to lay out all of my plans and the work that I’ve done behind them.
But for me, this is about bringing our country together again and I will do everything I can to heal the divides – the divides economically because there’s too much inequality, the racial divides, the continuing discrimination against the LGBT community so that we will work together.
And yes, finally, fathers will be able to say to their daughters, “You too can grow up to be president.”
