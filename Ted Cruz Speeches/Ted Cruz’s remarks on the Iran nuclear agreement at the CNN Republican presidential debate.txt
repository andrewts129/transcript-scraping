…The single biggest national security threat facing America right now is the threat of a nuclear Iran.
We’ve seen six and a half years of President Obama leading from behind. Weakness is provocative in this Iranian nuclear deal is nothing short of catastrophic.
This deal on its face will send over $100 billion to the Ayatollah Khomeini, making the Obama administration’s the world leading financier of radical Islamic terrorism.
This deal abandons four American hostages in Iran and this deal will only accelerate Iran’s acquiring of nuclear weapons. You’d better believe it.
If I am elected President on the very first day in office, I will rip to shreds this catastrophic Iranian nuclear deal.
