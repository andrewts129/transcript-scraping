Unbelievable. I have to start by saying I absolutely love the people of Iowa. Unbelievable. Unbelievable.
So on June 16th when we started this journey, there were 17 candidates. I was told by everybody, “Do not go to Iowa. You could never finish even in the top 10.”
And I said, “But I have friends in Iowa. I know a lot of people in Iowa. I think they’ll really like me. Let’s give it a shot.”
They said, “Don’t do it.” I said, “I have to do it.”
And we finished second, and I want to tell you something: I’m just honored. I’m really honored.
And I want to congratulate Ted, and I want to congratulate all of the incredible candidates, including Mike Huckabee, who’s become a really good friend of mine. So congratulations to everybody. Congratulations.
I want to thank all of the folks that worked with us. We had a great team and we will continue to have a great team.
And we’re just so happy with the way everything worked out.
And most importantly, I have to thank my wife and Lara and Eric and Vanessa and Don. They went out and they were doing speeches. And in fact, Don and Eric, I think you did about six speeches today. So, I just want to thank my family. They have been so amazing and so supportive.
And we’ve had every indication – we’re going now on – we have a poll we’re at 28 points ahead. Okay? New Hampshire – we love New Hampshire. We love South Carolina.
And we’re leaving tonight and tomorrow afternoon we’ll be in New Hampshire and that’ll be something special. It’s going to be a great week and we’re going to be up here next weekend. And I think we’re going to be proclaiming victory, I hope.
I will say this: I don’t know who’s going to win between Bernie and Hillary. I don’t know what’s going to happen with Hillary’s got other problems, maybe bigger than the problems she’s got in terms of nominations.
But we’ve had so many different indications and polls that we beat her and we beat her easily. And we will go on to get the Republican nomination and we will go on to easily beat Hillary or Bernie or whoever the hell they throw up there.
Iowa, we love you. We thank you. You’re special. We will be back many, many times. In fact, I think I might come here and buy a farm. I love it. Okay?
Thank you! Thank you everybody! Thank you very much!
