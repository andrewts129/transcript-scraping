I was proud to lead 31 states before the U.S. Supreme Court defending the Second Amendment and we won that landmark victory.
And indeed, just a couple of years ago when Harry Reid and Barack Obama came after the right to keep and bear arms of millions of Americans, I was proud to lead the fight in the United States Senate to protect our right to keep and bear arms.
