…The number one test for use of military force should be the vital national security interests of the United States.
The reason why I opposed President Obama bombing Syria is because he couldn’t answer the question “What do you do if chemical weapons end up in the hands of radical Islamic terrorists like al-Nusra, like al-Qaeda, like ISIS?
Now, I also want to respond to several of the folks up here who said we should trust this Iranian deal and see if the Iranians will comply. Anyone who’s paying attention to what Khomeini says knows that they will not comply.
There’s a reason why Khomeini refers to Israel as the “little Satan” and America as the “great Satan”.
In the middle of negotiating this treaty, Khomeini led the assembled masses in chanting “Death to America”.
I’m reminded of a great editorial cartoon. It shows the Ayatollah Khomeini saying “Death to all Americans” and it shows John Kerry coming back and saying “Can we meet you halfway?”
We need a commander in chief who will stand up and protect this country.
And I’ll tell you I can’t wait to stand on that debate stage with Hillary Clinton and to make abundantly clear if you vote for Hillary, you were voting for the Ayatollah Khomeini to possess a nuclear weapon.
And if you elect me as President, under no circumstances will a theocratic ayatollah who chants “Death to America” ever be allowed to acquire a nuclear weapon.
