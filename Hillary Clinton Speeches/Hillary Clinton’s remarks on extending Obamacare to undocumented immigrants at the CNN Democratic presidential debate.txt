Well, first of all, I want to make sure every child gets health care. That’s why I helped to create the Children’s Health Insurance Program, and I want to support states that are expanding health care and including undocumented children and others.
I want to open up the opportunity for immigrants to be able to buy into the exchanges under the Affordable Care Act.
I think to go beyond that, as I understand what Gov. O’Malley has recommended so that they would get the same subsidies, I think that is – it raises so many issues. It would be very difficult to administer. It needs to be part of comprehensive immigration reform when we finally do get to it.
