God bless the great state of Indiana.
Elections are about choices. The Republican Party faces a choice today.
Indiana and America, I believe, want to unite behind a positive, optimistic forward-looking conservative campaign based on real policies…to the problems facing this country.
And the American people deserve a real choice in November.
A choice and not an echo. A meaningful distinction.
If we come to November and the American are given a choice between two big government liberals, two Washington insiders enmeshed in the corruption of Washington, then we as Republican Party will have failed the American people.
And I will tell you when you run for president, one of the most solemn choices you make is the choice of selecting a vice presidential candidate.
This is a choice that you are telling the American people this is an individual who I trust and even more importantly this is an individual you can trust to lead this country no matter what might happen.
Any responsible candidate for president would have spent much time assessing possible candidates, thinking through the pros and cons, studying who these people are, praying about it, and examining the potential candidates.
And you know, the characteristics that you look for in a vice president are indeed the very same characteristics you look for in a president.
First of all, knowledge. Do they know enough to do the job? Do they know where jobs come from? Do they understand why jobs are leaving America? Do they understand why manufacturing jobs are being driven overseas? Do they understand why Carrier has left Indiana and gone to Mexico? Do they understand what is happening in the economy and government? Do they understand the Constitution and Bill of Rights? Are these words on a paper or are these promises that protect our fundamental right?
And security. Do they understand the threats facing us in the world? The threats that potentially endanger your children and mine.
That’s the first criteria you look to as knowledge. Does this person have the experience and knowledge to do the job?

And security. Do they understand the threats facing us in the world? The threats that potentially endanger your children and mine.
That’s the first criteria you look to as knowledge. Does this person have the experience and knowledge to do the job?

Secondly, you look to judgment. Do they have the judgment and wisdom to bear the mantle of a job whose responsibilities have grayed the hair of every person ever to hold that office?
Do they think through decisions in a rash and impulsive way?
Do they pop off the handle at whatever strikes them at any given moment? Or do they think through careful, measured?
Do they assemble a team around them who are smarter than they are? You know, there’s an old adage in management that As hire As and Bs hire Cs.
If you see a leader who deliberately surrounds himself with people who are not capable, who are not informed, who are not skilled and who would never, ever, ever stand up to that leader, it tells you that leader is not a leader but someone not at all secure in who they are.
And the third thing you look to is character. Are they honest? Do they have core principles that come from their gut are not a momentary dalliance announced today to be abandoned tomorrow? But do they know who they are when they look into the mirror? Is it based on whatever the media tells them that given day, whatever the fad is that given moment, whatever is trending on Twitter? Or do they have a foundation?
And integral to character, how do they treat others? How do they treat others, especially those they don’t have to be nice to.
You know, everyone knows how to kiss up. Everyone can be nice to their boss. That is not a complicated skill. But how do they treat the clerk at the convenience store? How do they treat the average man and woman? How do they treat the American citizen? How do they treat the vulnerable?
That reveals everything you need to know about character.
After a great deal of time and thought, after a great deal of consideration and prayer, I have come to the conclusion that if I am nominated to be president of the United States that I will run on a ticket with my vice presidential nominee, Carly Fiorina.
Born in Texas, the very first thing I liked about her, Carol Carleton Fiorina known throughout the country simply by the name of Carly is an extraordinary leader.
She started working as a secretary in a small firm. And she climbed the corporate ladder to become the CEO of the largest technology company in the world.

She started working as a secretary in a small firm. And she climbed the corporate ladder to become the CEO of the largest technology company in the world.

And the first female CEO in the history of a Fortune 20 company.
A graduate of Stanford and MIT, Carly is brilliant and capable and yet she experienced the hard scrabble world of being a woman professional in a business world that extracts a price.
I say that as a son of a pioneering computer programmer – my mother who started in the computer industry in the 1950s. I say that as the husband of my wife Heidi Cruz, who spent two decades in the business industry.
Over and over again, Carly has shattered glass ceilings.
But in addition to being a woman of extraordinary intelligence, she is also a woman of deep principle. She’s served as the chairman of the American Conservative Foundation, championing conservative principles on a national level.
She has studied the threats facing our national security, serving as the Chairman of the CIA’s External Advisory Board.
And if you look to the criteria I laid out, let’s start number one with knowledge. She knows from having spent a lifetime how to produce jobs, how to expand jobs, how to raise wages.
She knows firsthand that the key to economic growth is not government and more and more government, it is rather less and less government.
My opponent in this race, Donald Trump, like Hillary Clinton and Bernie Sanders looks to government as the answer to every problem.
Carly knows firsthand from decades in the business world running one of the 20 largest corporations in America where jobs come from.
And she respects the Constitution and Bill of Rights. They are not – you know, if a candidate views the Bill of Rights as an occasional inconvenience – something to be talked about one day and ignored the next – if a candidate views religious liberty as something to be cast aside when it’s inconvenient, if a candidate views the Second Amendment right to keep and bear arms is merely a suggestion, they don’t have the grounding to be president.
Carly respects the Constitution and the Bill of Rights and she understands the threats facing America. She understands this is a dangerous world.
And in naming her as my vice presidential nominee, I am also telling you that she is someone you can be confident in if the occasion should arise to be commander in chief and keep this country safe.
We need a president who isn’t neutral between Israel and the Palestinians.
We need a president who will not keep in place this Iranian nuclear deal but who will rip it to shreds.

We need a president who will not keep in place this Iranian nuclear deal but who will rip it to shreds.

And the second criteria – judgment. You know, it was seven weeks ago today that Carly endorsed our campaign.
When Carly initially endorsed, before that announcement, she and I sat down and talked at great lengths.
And one of the things that struck me in that conversation – she said, “I have a condition for endorsement.” I kind of sat back and said, “All right. What is that?” She said, “I don’t do anything halfway. If I endorse, I want to be all in. I want to be campaigning. I want to be working. I want to be doing everything I can to make the case to the American people.”
That’s the kind of condition you’d like to hear.
Her condition was “My endorsement is not just an empty rubber stamp. A one momentary fluff in the wind. It is rather a full commitment.” Because Carly looked at me and said, “Our country is in crisis and we’ve got to do this together.”
And since that time, I have seen her day in and day out on the campaign bus going from stop to stop to stop that she is careful. She is measured. She is serious.
She doesn’t get overly excited. She doesn’t get rattled by whatever is getting thrown at.
And you know, we all saw that when in one of the earliest debates, Carly confronted Donald Trump. A man who in his characteristic understatement said of her, “Look at that face.”
And everyone of us remembers the grace, the class, the élan in which Carly responded. Responded to Donald that she knew exactly what he knew exactly what he was saying and that every woman in America knew exactly what Donald Trump was saying.
You know, one of the great principles of bullies – they feed off of fear. They feed off of people who would cower in the corner when they yell and scream and insult and holler and curse and they don’t know what to do when a strong, powerful woman stands up and says “I am not afraid.”
The third characteristic that is also important for a president is character. At the end of the day, it’s all about character.
If the president is a no good scoundrel, if the president is a narcissist, if the president is abusive and angry, they will not and cannot be a good president.
And for anyone we need only look to the past seven years to see what happens.
And a good president must have known struggle. Must be able to understand those who are struggling. If you’ve always lived a life of privilege, if you’ve always been told you are the chosen one, that has real impacts on the job you could do as president.
When Carly started as a secretary in a small firm in an environment in a business world that was not always welcoming to women, she knew and knows what it’s like to struggle in the workplace each and everyday.
But she’s also faced personal struggle, including being diagnosed with breast cancer. Battling cancer and surviving cancer.

But she’s also faced personal struggle, including being diagnosed with breast cancer. Battling cancer and surviving cancer.

As a son who was by my mother’s side when she battled breast cancer, I know first hand how devastating that disease could be and I know what a testament it is to her strength and grit and fortitude that she came roaring back, ready to conquer the world.
Carly has known tragedy, including the loss of her step-daughter to a drug overdose.
There is no pain on the face of the planet commensurate with the pain of a parent losing a child.
And Carly has struggled through that and going through the personal struggles. Everyone here has faced personal struggles but it is when you are facing the void, when you are facing the abyss that you find your character, you find who you are, you find your faith, you find your ground.
Maybe that’s why Carly isn’t intimidated by bullies because she’s faced challenges a lot worse than someone bellowing and yellowing and insulting her face.
Let me tell you on a personal level, Heidi and I have become friends with Carly. We’ve spent time with her on the campaign trail. We’ve laughed. We’ve watched basketball games together. We have marveled at this crazy, wild journey.
And I’ll tell you, our girls – Caroline and Catherine – have come to adore Carly.
On the bus on the campaign trail, Carly makes up songs and sings them to Caroline and Catherine. And our girls, mind you, they’re eight and five, both regularly text Carly.
And let me tell you, Carly may become the first vice president in history to have a very, impressive fluency with heart and smiley face emoticons. And when you’re texting with a five-year-old girl or an eight-year-old girl, those are highly valuable.
Now, listen, some might ask why now. It’s tradition that a vice presidential nominee is announced at the convention. It is unusual to make the announcement as early as we’re doing so now.
Well, I think all would acknowledge this race, if anything, it is unusual.
Where we are now the mainstream media, the New York media executives, and the Washington lobbyists, are all trying to tell the American people the race is over.
But let me tell you where we are right now. Where we are right now, nobody is getting to 1,237 delegates.
I’m not getting to 1,237 delegates, and Donald J. Trump is not getting to 1,237 delegates.
And the Hoosier state is going to have a powerful voice in making that clear.
So why make this announcement now? Well, for one thing, if we are to win, number one win the nomination but number two even more importantly win the general election, we must unite.
And Carly is a vice presidential nominee who I believe is superbly skilled, superbly gifted at helping unite this party, bring us together so we stand united as one.

Secondly, I make this announcement today so that you the voters – the voters in Indiana, the voters in Nebraska, the voters in South Dakota and Washington state, and California and across the country – so that you will know what you will get.
The voters deserve to know – you deserve to have a candidate who doesn’t change as the wind blows in any given moment. You deserve to know exactly where our candidates stand.
The final reason for making the decision now is to give the American people a clear choice. Elections are about choices.
You know, across this country, millions of Americans are struggling with an economy that isn’t working, with the Obama-Clinton economy that is stagnant, are seeing the Bill of Rights under assault – religious liberty, the Second Amendment violated by the federal government, a Supreme Court hanging in the balance, a president who abandons our friends and allies, whether it is Great Britain or whether it is Israel.
And a president who is unwilling to stand up to confront radical Islamic terrorism and defeat ISIS.
Some in the media will say, “Wouldn’t it be easier just to throw up your hands and say surrender?”
Donald Trump has won some of the races so we should step back and let him win them all.
If we nominate a candidate who is a big government New York liberal, who is a Washington insider, who agrees with Hillary Clinton and Barack Obama on issue after issue after issue, and whose lobbyist campaign manager has told us “He is only playing a part. This is only a role”, he is lying to us, then we as a Republican Party would have failed profoundly for this country because the men and women of Indiana know if we get people a clear choice between freedom and tyranny, between prosperity and poverty, between vulnerability and weakness and peace through strength that the American people will choose the Constitution and jobs and freedom and security over and over again.
The difference between Carly and me on the one side and Donald Trump and Hillary Clinton on the other side could not be starker.
If you want someone that will stand and fight for the working men and women of this country, fight for the men and women with callouses on your hand, fight for the single moms, fight for the young people, fight for those who are struggling and want to achieve the American dream, then do not go with the Washington insiders who have sold us down the river.
This ticket is about the future. It is about our children. It is about our grandchildren. The stakes of this election – we are not simply wagering on a sporting contest. We are involved in a fight that every one of us is privileged to be here to be fighting to save the greatest country in the history of the world, to make sure that the next generation has every bit as much freedom and opportunity as each of us was blessed to have.
And with that, I am pleased to introduce to you an extraordinary leader, my friend, and the next vice president of the United States Carly Fiorina.
