Well, let me tell you, Donald Trump and his billionaire friends under my policies are going to pay a hell of a lot more in taxes today – taxes in the future than they’re paying today.
But in terms of education, this is what I think. This is the year 2015. A college degree today…is the equivalent of what a high school degree was 50 years ago.
And what we said 50 years ago and 100 years ago is that every kid in this country should be able to get a high school education regardless of the income of their family.
I think we have to say that is true for everybody going to college.
I think we don’t need a complicated system, which the Secretary is talking about – income goes up, income’s down, if you’re poor you have to work and so forth and so on.
I pay for my program by the way through a tax on Wall Street speculation, which will not only make public colleges and universities tuition free, it will substantially lower interest rates on college debt – a major crisis in this country.
