I have now seen Director Comey’s letter to Congress.
We are 11 days out from perhaps the most important national election of our lifetimes. Voting is already underway in our country.
So the American people deserve to get the full and complete facts immediately.
The director himself has said he doesn’t know whether the emails referenced in his letter are significant or not.
I’m confident whatever they are will not change the conclusion reached in July.
Therefore it’s imperative that the bureau explain this issue and question whatever it is without any delay.
So I look forward to moving forward to focus on the important challenges facing the American people, winning on Nov. 8th, and working with all Americans to build a better future for our country.
Thank you.
First we knew about it is I assume when you knew about it, when this letter sent to Republican members of the House was released.
So we don’t know the facts, which is why we’re calling on the FBI to release all the information that it has.
Even Director Comey noted that this new information may not be significant. So let’s get it out.
So I would urge everybody to get out and vote early in all the states that have early voting because I think Americans want a president who can lead our country, who can get the economy working for everyone, not just those at the top, and who can bring our country together.
I offer that. I can do that. And I’m very confident that the American people know that and we’re going to continue to discuss what’s at stake in this election because I believe that it’s one of the most consequential elections ever.
So we’ve made it very clear that if they’re going to be sending this kind of letter that is only going originally to Republican members of the House that they need to share whatever facts they claim to have with the American people, and that’s what I expect to happen.
Thank you all.
