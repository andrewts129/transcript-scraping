Well, let me address college affordability because I have a plan that I think will really zero on what the problems are.
First, all the 40 million Americans who currently have student debt will be able to refinance their debt to a low interest rate. That will save thousands of dollars for people who are not struggling under this cumbersome, burdensome college debt.
As a young student in Nevada said to me, the hardest thing about going to college should not be paying for it.
So then we have to make it more affordable. How do we make it more affordable?
My plan would enable anyone to go to a public college or university tuition free. You would not have to borrow money for tuition.
But I do believe – and maybe it’s because I worked when I went through college, I worked when I went through law school – I think it’s important for everybody to have some part of getting this accomplished. That’s why I called it a compact.
So yes, I would like students to work 10 hours in order to make it possible for them to afford their education and I want colleges to get their costs down. They’re outrageously high in what they’re charging.
