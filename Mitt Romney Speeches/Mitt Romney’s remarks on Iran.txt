“Iran today has never been closer to a nuclear weapons capability.  It has never posed a greater danger to our friends, our allies, and us.  And it has never acted less deterred by America, as was made clear last year when Iranian agents plotted to assassinate the Saudi Ambassador in our nation’s capital.
“And yet, when millions of Iranians took to the streets in June of 2009, when they demanded freedom from a cruel regime that threatens the world, when they cried out, ‘Are you with us, or are you with them?’ —the American President was silent.”
