First of all, I want to build a wall – a wall that works. So important and it’s a big part part of it.
Second of all, we have a lot of really bad dudes in this country from outside and I think Chris knows that maybe as well as anybody.
They go, if I get elected, first day they’re gone. Gangs all over the place. Chicago, Baltimore, no matter where you live.
We have a country based on laws. I will make sure those laws are adhered to.
These are illegal immigrants.
I don’t think you’d even be asking this question if I didn’t run. Because when I ran and I brought this up at my opening marks at Trump Tower, I took heat like nobody has taken heat in a long time.
And then they found out with the killing of Kate from San Francisco and so many other crimes, they found that I was right. And most people, many people apologized to me.
I don’t think you’d even be talking about illegal immigration if it weren’t for me.
So, we have a country of laws. They’re going to go out and they’ll come back if they deserve to come back.
If they’ve had a bad record, if they’ve been arrested, if they’ve been in jail, they’re never coming back.
We’re going to have a country again. Right now we don’t have a country, we don’t have a border, and we’re going to do something about it and it can be done with proper management and it can be done with heart.
