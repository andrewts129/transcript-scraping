I’m Donald Trump. I wrote the Art of the Deal.
I say not in a braggadocious way I’ve made billions and billions of dollars dealing with people all of the world.
And I want to put whatever that talent is to work for this country so we have great trade deals, we make our country rich again, we make it great again, we build up our military, we take care of our vets, we get rid of Obamacare, and we have a great life all together.
Thank you.
